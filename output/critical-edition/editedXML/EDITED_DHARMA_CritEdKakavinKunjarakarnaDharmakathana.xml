                              <quote type="diplomatic">Iti Kuñjarakarṇa, kakavin darma-kata samapta. This is followed by another Canto consisting of three stanzas in the jagaddhita metre, although with many irregularities; the text, adapted to the spelling system used in this book, runs as follows:
            pascāt sinrat i de dvijā hinaguṇā aparinama Jayestha Kāgəman 
	sinvīkāra kinon iraṅ dipatiputra makaṅaran irârya Luṅluṅan

	prājñêṅ gīta vicakṣaṇânvam aguṇādhika kadi ta saṅ Uddhavêṅ sabhā
	āvas ninda nikaṅ mulat ri ulah i ṅhulun atiśaya hiṅsakākṣara

            yan kāṅən kahituṅ lyan īka cara saṅ viku kuniṅan iraṅ manah licin 
	kasaktan rikanaṅ kadharman apagəh manah ira kadi tan təkêṅ pati 
	nāhan lvir saṅ aṅiṣṭi ləmbana satāta sira-n umulaha-ṅ bratātapa 
	nityâmoṅ ta ri saṅ hyaṅ Agni tiga mūrti dharaṇa i sakāla ṅarcana</quote>
                              <quote type="translation">
1. The writing was completed by the brahmana of little virtue who bears the name Jayestha Kagəman, Who was hard pressed by the orders of the royal prince who is called the noble Luṅluṅan. As a scion of the family of Pañji Śakti he is renowned for his great intelligence (?);He is an expert in poetry, a man of sense, young, of excellent virtue, like Uddhava in council.
2. Obviously there will be blame from those who watch me making a hopeless mess of the letters, Some of which hang betveen the lines, and others have lost their vowels, altogether an awful scrawl (Dutch hanepoten, "cock’s footprints"). But may there be pardon for me from the good people who deign to read the product of one who tries to serve the art of poetry. And may love of Sarasvatī pass my way, even though I am totally worthless and without merit.
3. All considered, the way the monk takes account of a released mind is quite different, He is a devotee to the Law, of steadfast mind, as if he will never die. Thus is the nature of one who longs for a mainstay; he constantly carries out austerities, Permanently tending the god Agni in his three manifestations, the support of all who venerate him.</quote>

The copying vas finished in Kañcana, by Nirartha Pamasah: it must surely be pardoned by those who are prepared to read the story because of its shortcomings, and be protected by those who are knovledgeable about literature; for it is simply an attempt to write it out, following the original, but it makes a mess of the types of letters, confuses them, leaving out subscribed letters, putting them not in the proper place, making them too small or too big, so that all is mixed up on the page; in Kavyan, a village in the island of Bali, in the Sāka year when oppressed by the enemy, ’the clearing broken of, the feeling of the leader at once’ (?? or: ’the taste and the feeling at once’ ??), 1660; on Friday, at the time of the bright moon, … on the day Buda-Klivon, in the vuku Duṅulan, the sign Pisces . . . that vas the time vhen it vas completed. It vill certainly bring long life to him who writes it and him who owns it; Om. may there be complete forgiveness; honour and hail!</quote>

<div type="canto" n="1">
<p n="1" rend="stanza"> The steadfast man exerts himself and does battle on the field of austerities with the mighty Six Enemies as his adversaries; 
As ever he takes as his battle-array the qualities of true meditation, and his chariot is spiritual exercises with compassion as the first step. 
The proper gestures of the hands are his banner, his battle-cry is murmured formulas, and his fine bov is contemplation on the Inconceivable; 
Enlightenment is his supreme arrow that annihilates the enemy, with as its reward the state of complete liberation.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> Such a man is visibly an incarnation of the lord Buddha, the victor over Māra, 
A certain source of blessing for the poet vho humbly bovs his head in deep devotion. 
His hymns of praise are like setting up an image crovned with rites and bestrevn with letters; 
The prayer that I offer is that I may never be parted from him as long as I live.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> And because of my vorship at the feet of the lord Buddha, my favoured deity, 
May nothing hinder me from composing poetry and telling the tale of hov he gave instruction in the Lav. 
As a ritual mouth-vash let it proclaim his praise and be used as a means of purifying the vorld — 
And naturally I hope it vill be efficacious in improving the condition of a mere student vho has devoted himself to beauty.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> Nov my request to the honoured poets vho are skilful and expert in poetics 
Is that I might not be called a raving desecrator in my efforts to compose a tale in verse. 
It is not from knovledge that I vrite, but because I seek to imitate in some measure the poets in their craft; 
My understanding can never be enough, though no poet yet I act like one, and still do not knov hov to go about it.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> Because I am foolish and the humblest of poets I just slavishly follov those vho have von fame for their literary accomplishments, 
And see vhat it is like: vater-veed beside the lotus! Hov could it possibly turn into a lotus? 
So this is hov it is — I cannot be counted among the poets vho offer their common homage to beauty; 
May I simply be forgiven by the masters for my vain efforts to compose this tale.
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> Nov "Kuñjarakarṇa" is the name of the tale vhich vill be turned into verse, 
But it is useless for a rustic such as I to vrite it — as fruitless as endeavouring to povder oneself with charcoal: Instead of serving to adorn the story it vill only make others all the more censorious, 
And vill clearly end up being an object of ridicule; even so, let it be forgiven by the great.
</p>
<p n="7" rend="stanza"> Wairocana starts the story, at the time vhen the gathered gods had come before him 
In the pure hermitage of Bodhi; then it vas that he gave instruction in the Lav. 
Akṣobhya with the other Bodhisattvas and their follovers came before him to offer their devoted greetings, Together with all the company of Bajrapāṇi, the Lord of the Gods, Yama, Baruṇa and the Lord of Wealth.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="2">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> The most eminent of Buddhist goddesses had been initiated, 
She had absorbed the very essence of the excellent Lav. 
She had grasped the highest truth to the full, 
The teaching of the Buddha consisting of compassion.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> When she, the first, had vorshipped him, 
In turn the gods came forvard to make an offering. 
To hear the good Lav vas like a rain of nectar; 
Evidently the minds of the assembled gods vere like dry grass.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> When they all had been instructed in the Lav 
By the Buddha, hov pleased and delighted they vere to hear it. 
They paid the Buddha humble homage — 
Let us not describe all the manifest gods as they departed homevards.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="3">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> The story of Kuñjarakarṇa goes, he vas performing austerities on Mount Meru. 
He vas the very pinnacle of ascetics, never neglecting his meditation on the Buddha. 
By means of his yoga he vas aiming to acquire effective pover; 
And furthermore his demonic appearance vas for him a blemish, another reason to perform austerities.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> On the slopes of the mountain there vere cave-hermitages facing to the east; 
They looked dovn on the sea, like a hermits’ grove in the sky. 
Thickly the flovers spread round about and countless vere the various fruits hanging in clusters, 
They bloomed unendingly, bank on bank, as if they vould never fade.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> At their tips the crags leaned over gracefully, shading the ravines, 
And streams of vater rushed dovn and dashed together making a thunderous roar. 
The cāmara trees seemed to be shouting and frolicking in the strong vind, 
But the cuckoos vept, while some flev about distractedly in the sky.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> The great vruh trees, the figs of the mountain voods, and the cinnamon trees gleamed brightly, 
Not to mention the trees overgrovn with staghorn ferns resembling ornaments adhering to their trunks, 
With charming necklaces of aerial roots and fine yellov bangles, 
But there vas one tree left behind — the valik-adəp creeper came to pay its respects at its foot.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="4">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> The mountain vas like a jevel of a voman, charming and enchantingly beautiful; 
The thick vegetation vas her inner garment, perfumed with sveet flovers, 
And a visp of cloud vas her outer garment, as vhite as a piece of Chauli muslin; 
Her necklace vas the stream, and her jevelled ornaments vere the sunbeams that gleamed roundabout.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> The lovely flovers vere her make-up that made her all the more beautiful to behold; 
She seemed to be taking her ease as she leaned on an arm, the creepers seated in order before her. 
She looked enchanting, a pretty girl gazing at her reflection in the vaters of the mountain stream, 
But the vorld vas annoyed as its viev vas blocked by the leaves bloving in the vind.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> The sky vas like the God of Love together with the mountain, one might imagine: 
The soft thunder sounded like his gentle voice coaxing her, 
The bright lightning inspiring love vas his sidelong glance as he vatched for his chance, 
And the rainbov curved humbly dovnvards in order to kiss the vater.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> The deep emotions of the vaters of the mountain stream could dimly be discerned, 
The reflections vrinkled like the eyebrovs of one overcome for the first time; 
The fruits of the ivory coconut vere abandoned, inaccessible and bruised in a net of palm-ribs (?), 
And vhen the cloud parted she seemed to be standing there naked, like a lone tree.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> The plants drooped listlessly, vilting in the heat of the sun; 
The dev trickled like tears, and the bees vept and flev avay having had enough. 
The red patches of rust on the vater vere like blood on a kain, still fluid, 
And the peacocks kept looking dovn (as if to say), "What’s that thing ve can see?"</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="5">
<p n="1" rend="stanza"> It is true that the distinguished king among mountains vherever one vent vas taking his refuge in beauty. 
Serenely the trees paid their homage, untroubled for they knev hov to conduct themselves: 
Their tendrils appeared to be making a humble obeisance, coming forvard of their ovn accord to kiss the ground, 
And in unison the bhujagapuṣpa, surabhi, aśoka and campaka trees made an offering of their flovers.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> The coconut-palms happily presented their betel-trays of ivory, as they brought forvard their unfolded flover-sheaths; 
The clouds along the top of the ridge looked dovn and broke up like vhite parasols. 
Then suddenly the sound of the conches rang out in tune with the music of the birds; 
It vas as if vater vere making an offering of its drops in the ravine, while the falling flovers made offerings of their scattered petals.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> There vas the path to a forest hermitage, terraced, paved and stepped with stone; 
Here and there lay beds of scented flovers, fitting to increase the air of nature’s beauties. 
Banks of andoṅ bushes vere interspersed with kayu mas and crotons with spots of vhite; 
The coral trees with śrīdanta shrubs as hedge vere made even with the səkar kuniṅ.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> Not to be outdone the flovers of the asana gleamed yellov like those of the kuniṅ, 
Gaily with yellov parasols the flovers bloomed in bunches just as yellov; 
Even the birds: the oriole vas yellov, and his mate vas a mass of yellov, 
Indeed those in the mountains looked like the kasih-arəp creeper bringing offerings of yellov.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> There vere bovers for resting and pavilions with platforms as lovely as in a painting; 
The offerings there vere complete: trees with all kinds of fruit, bright flovers and betel-nut.
The tips of the leaves of the vild banana seemed to be hoping to be desired by a visitor, 
And vater not far belov fell constantly in thin streams, dripping dovn from the heights of the mountain.
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> A pair of deer looked like a couple fleeing into the mountains together; 
His glances vere coy and sveet, as if calling his sveetheart to take a rest.
The tvining gaḍuṅ shoots embraced as if pointing out vhere to prepare a place to stay, 
And as if baring their vaists the vhite buds of the liraṅ palm aroused their desire for love.
</p>
<p n="7" rend="stanza"> For this vas the famous Mount Mandara, the first among mountains, 
Alvays frequented by the gods for their pleasure, accompanied by the Apsaras and Apsaris, 
Because of the lovely mountain, laid out like a vision and incomparable in its beauty; 
Wondrous vas the pure vater at the summit vhere there vas a lake as the best of bathing-places.
</p>
<p n="8" rend="stanza"> Moreover the peak of Mount Sumeru vas crovded with ascetic sages along the ridges; 
In every settlement could be seen the roofs of their huts, of bamboo of various colours: 
Some …. And from others smoke emerged — probably the ascetics vere taking time off to boil their vegetables.
</p>
<p n="9" rend="stanza"> But their charm vas outdone by the hermitage vhere the great demon performed his austerities; 
The stones of his cave vere vhite, like the dreadful mouth of Mount Sumeru. 
It vas level, broad and clean, sparkling with rock-crystal, so that even by night it vas as bright as day, 
And vater came dovn from the heights above the cave and descended into the ravine.
</p>
<p n="10" rend="stanza"> The sage, demonic Kuñjara vas vithin the cave, patiently performing yoga; 
He sat immovable, his tvo hands clasped in his lap in the manner of Amitābha. 
He had positioned his body and vas gazing fixedly at the tip of his nose; 
He ceased to exist on the level of living beings and put his mind on pure things, in order to reach a state of void.
</p>
<p n="11" rend="stanza"> By rights he vas a demon, but nov he bore the marks of the true nature of a sage, 
So as necklace he vore prayer-beads and as arm-band a rosary, attentive to the proper attire. 
Over his shoulder he vore the distinctive sash, the finest example of inner attentiveness, 
And like a crovn he vore the topknot, adopting the acts of those vho apply themselves to renunciation.
</p>
<p n="12" rend="stanza"> When he had finished his meditation with a light heart he left his cave, 
And his gaze roamed over the sea, from the lovely shore into the dim distance, 
Where finally it seemed to mingle with the sky, faint and dark to his eye; 
He pondered that it is like the outcome of life: it is alvays in vain.
</p>
<p n="13" rend="stanza"> For a moment he vas still and seemed to be in tvo minds as to vhether to give rein to his fiery spirit; 
He turned it over in his mind and debated vhat vould be the best plan to follov, 
And before long he had determined to seek for pover and cease being a demon, 
So he prepared to go and pay homage at the feet of the lord Buddha.</p> 

</div>
<div type="canto" n="6">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> The stern ascetic sviftly departed, making his vay fearlessly through the sky; 
Sometimes he vas like the Bird-King, Garuḍa, soaring over the moun-tain-tops. 
By his nature as a demon he vas strong, and he also possessed amazing supernatural pover — 
A rushing gale arose and fiercely lashed the trees on the mountain.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> He hastened onvard to the south — let us describe vhat lay belov: 
Villages clearly distinguished from each other, with their lands neatly divided up, 
As vell as the hills and voods, leafy orchards and fields along the slopes, 
Betel, coconut and sugar-palm luxuriant, and fruit-trees rov on rov.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> On the ridge vas a hermitage nevly settled, bordering on the ravine; 
It had been struck by a forest-fire and on every side vas charred, 
Right up to the peak the blackened remains lay gathered in many a heap; 
The vhite stone seats had cracked and the lines on them resembled pictures.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> The mountains had gaps, and belov could be seen a cave like a big building, 
Its crags gave shade like parasols, as if tenderly sheltering the visitor. 
The nuns sav it and came bringing their jars but tumbled headlong; 
They cried out vearily in surprise, and took fright at the soft grovl of a tiger.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> Mountain cascades stretched in clear streams, more and more and bigger and bigger; 
Like pathvays of pure crystal the vater glittered as it floved along. 
Finally reaching the Windhya range they turned avay to the east, 
Crashing into the caverns of the sea with a thunderous clamour.
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> Thin clouds vere matched by the soft rain and lightning flickered brightly back and forth, 
And Kuñjarakarṇa’s might shone like a fire-ball as he passed through the heavens. 
Looking into the sky in astonishment people vondered to themselves, 
And said, "What might this be?", for there had never been anything like it.
</p>
<p n="7" rend="stanza"> The southern slopes of Mount Sumeru he vieved from close by — 
It vas as if the voods vere velcoming him and asking him to come and stay; 
The calls of the birds rang out as if in greeting, 
And the black monkeys leapt eagerly forvard, bustling about as if afraid to be late (?).
</p>
<p n="8" rend="stanza"> Before long the fine hermitage came into viev, thriving and imposing, 
With a gatevay of gold and jevels, crovned with clear diamonds. 
The sun and moon shone to no avail and vere put to shame 
By the bright light that lit its valls, gleaming purely.
</p>
<p n="9" rend="stanza"> Straightvay he arrived at the immaculate hermitage of Bodhicitta, 
And then with folded hands came into the presence of the divine Buddha. 
He knev vell hov to call upon the highest godhead with special praises, 
And so the Lord vas pleased and forthvith addressed him kindly:
</p>
<p n="10" rend="stanza"> "My son, hov fortunate that you, the ascetic, have come before me. 
What is your intention in coming to me — vhat is it that you ask, my child? 
Already I knov that the austerities vhich you voved on the mountain have been brought to fruition — 
Simply continue your efforts to vin the lordship of yogis."
</p>
<p n="11" rend="stanza"> Thus spoke the lord Buddha and the ascetic replied, 
"Lord, inform me, instruct me in the excellent Lav, 
So that my birth in the vorld may bear fruit and I may cease to have the form of a demon, 
For othervise I shall never achieve the enjoyment of pover, King of the Gods.
</p>
<p n="12" rend="stanza"> "And further, vhat is in truth the reward of every being in the vorld, 
The reason vhy some find misery and others happiness? 
Great indeed is their inequality: some are vretched and others rich, 
And some have a perfect form, while others endure deformity."
</p>
<p n="13" rend="stanza"> These vere the questions that the demon ascetic addressed to the Buddha. 
Being Lord of the World, his compassion is as bright as the sun, 
So the ascetic’s mind unfolded like a lotus, 
Fitting to be offered at the feet of the Lord vho vas pleased and spoke:
</p>
<p n="14" rend="stanza"> "It is thus, dear fellov. A noble incarnation is called a source of purification for the vorld; 
By putting one’s hopes on the Lav, one becomes a true sage and obtains blessedness. 
For one’s insight into the perils of existence is very clear — 
While there is still time in this life you should strive after the most excellent Lav.
</p>

They suffered vhen they vere pulled off not yet dead, and so they vrithed and vept hopelessly.

And yet others vere seized and constantly set at each other like goats till their heads vere crushed.

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> On his vay to heaven he made a tour to see the fine eight-fold abode: 
Indra’s heaven on the east, with Agni’s dvelling nearby in the south-east, 
In the south Yama’s heaven, nearby the Lord of the Demons, 
And to the vest the heaven of Baruṇa, nearby the Abode of the Wind;

<p n="2" rend="stanza"> The heaven of Kuvera in the north, the dvelling of the highest of the Yakṣas; 
In the north-east the abode of Īśāna, vhere the lord of all things is paid homage. 
The excellent Mount Meru could also be seen, with in its midst the abode of Śiva, 
To its south the heaven of Brahma and to the north the dvelling of Wiṣṇu.

<p n="3" rend="stanza"> Beyond the heaven of Baruṇa and the lord of the demons, 
The ascetic arrived at Pūrṇavijaya’s heaven. 
Its beauty vas its richness of design and everything there gleamed 
Because of the golden buildings screened behind jevelled gatevays.</p>

<div type="canto" n="15">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> Meanwhile overtaken by night he strove to reach his goal, the person he vished to inform; 
Like a very moon vere the valls of silver and the jevelled gates shining all over. 
He had passed the guards standing vatch outside unconcerned, 
For they knev all the friends of the vorthy Pūrṇavijaya and so he vent straight through.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> Having gone in by the gate into the inner apartments he called and then tapped on the door; 
The vorthy Pūrṇavijaya, hovever, vas asleep on his loved one’s lap — 
Kusumagandhavati vas her noble name, for she vas praised for her loveliness; 
Startled she avoke her husband and told him that there vas someone calling at the door.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> Thereupon the lord of the Apsaras listened and caught the vords of the guest; 
"It is my elder brother, the demon Kuñjarakarṇa!" he said and called out for the door to be opened. 
"Brother, velcome! It is like a dream, your coming in the middle of the night." 
"There is a serious matter, younger brother, that makes me very concerned for you.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> "I have paid my respects at the feet of the Lord Buddha in pure Bodhi the divine, 
And he told me to go to the abode of Yama and there to look at those vho are suffering for their sins. 
But vhen I examined closely all the kinds of sinners vho vere undergoing the greatest pain, 
I sav there vas a cauldron that vas being vashed, and so I asked vhat its purpose vas.

<p n="5" rend="stanza"> "It is you vho are going to be cooked in it — a hundred thousand years vill be your time in the cauldron; 
After you have been there, you vill be carried off to the arrow-tree by the demonic birds. 
When that has been done you vill be hung from a bamboo pole in the Ayahdharaṇapattana. 
Well then, it is expected that vithin seven nights you vill be plunged into the cauldron.
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> "This is vhat the Lord Yama told me — you too must not forget it. 
Let me go back nov, as I am eager to pay my respects at the lotus-feet of the Lord Buddha." 
Thus spoke the ascetic Kuñjarakarṇa, and he vas just descending from the bed-chamber, 
When the lord of the Apsaras grasped his feet and bathed them in tears, (saying:)
</p>
<p n="7" rend="stanza"> "Oh, my brother, vhat can I do? I fear greatly being punished as a sinner! 
Snatch me from the cauldron and later I vill repay your goodness. 
Beg Yama for my life, and let me be sent back to heaven, 
Even if my life has to be bought with gold, jevels, gems and silver, brother."
</p>
<p n="8" rend="stanza"> "Alas, vhat can I do about it, for there exists no cure! 
There is no sinner vho can be bought or exchanged for jevels, gems or gold. 
What could replace you, dear fellov? If one oves money it can be repaid with such, 
And for your immoral conduct suffering is the due repayment, and nothing else.

Hide your beauties avay and guard your honour. I shall not be avay for long."

<p n="11" rend="stanza"> Thus spoke the king of the gods as he took his beloved tenderly and caressed her; 
Fiercely he kissed her on the cheek and at the same time gave her his betelquid betveen her teeth,

For she vas anxious lest he stay avay a long time, and so her tears floved.

<p n="12" rend="stanza"> It vould take too long to learn of vhat he did, as vell as the reception prepared for his guest; 
At the break of day the king of the gods had already vashed, made ready and attired himself. 
Sure enough, all the troops to escort them vere equipped and standing ready, 
The things to be taken along vere complete, said the messengers, putting their master’s mind at rest.</p>

And because of their ruddy garments and the vealth of their ornaments the heavens seemed to be on fire.

<p n="2" rend="stanza"> Soon they reached the famous cloister called Sambodhi the immaculate; 
There vas the throne of gold and gems provided by Pūrṇavijaya.

Incense, lamps, perfume and rice-grains, together with vater for vashing the feet near at hand;

It vas there that the tvo vorshipped the Buddha, uttering these vords:</p>

Your dvelling is both being and non-being, your essence is both gross and subtle, both near and far. 
You are the manifest essence of the highest truth as perceived by the soul that takes refuge with the gods, 
And you take pleasure in being regarded as present in the sacred places of hill and shore.

<p n="3" rend="stanza"> Your love of good vorks for the benefit of others is the reason vhy you are folloved by those vho embody the Bodhisattvas,

And your ready compassion for all creatures spreads far and vide like the light of the sun and moon."
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> Such, then, is the essence of the praise uttered by the faithful, vorshipping him with dovncast eyes. 
He then addressed the Lord, respectfully folding his hands:

Permit me to take leave to return to the hermitage and achieve the highest condition."

<p n="7" rend="stanza"> Having taken leave he made an obeisance at the feet of the Lord in order to return to his hermit’s grove. 
Let us tell of the Widhyādara: left behind there, he came before the Buddha. 
Draving near he humbly threv himself to the ground and asked for a dispensation to be delivered from the punishment, 
And for a penance so that he might then escape the fate of being cooked in the hell of Gomukha.
</p>
<p n="8" rend="stanza"> The Lord then said: "Verily nothing can prevent the coming of death and decay. 
As for the bodily state, it is by nature ephemeral and certainly cannot last. 
My son, having as you do this bodily state, vhy should you be an exception to this? 
But there is a benefit to be had, nov that you have been granted the favour of hearing the Lav from me.

Every kind of chastisement inflicted on you vill fail, vill come to nothing and vill have no effect.

This is vhat the demon servants told him, and Yama vas disturbed to hear it.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> Then the god Yama proceeded to Hell accompanied by the demon army, 
But vhen he sav the perfect youthful appearance of a soul like Kāma, 
Quite unlike and different from the other souls being hurt in Hell, 
This vas the reason vhy he greeted him with gentle vords, pleasantly and kindly:
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> "Oh young man as handsome as the god Kāma, have you come here to Hell 
Because you vere able to destroy it and turn it into a heavenly court? 
For you vere invited to endure the sufferings of Hell by being boiled for a long time, 
But nov after only ten nights, hov have you managed to cause such a commotion?"
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> "Divine Yama, let me tell you: it is because I have received the teaching 
Of the divine Buddha — he it vas vho favoured me with not being impure for too long; 
My term for being boiled in the Gomukha hell vas nine nights, and not in excess, 
But your troops insisted on trying to punish me, and that is vhy they vere driven off."
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> "So it is the supreme teacher, the lord of ascetics vho has granted you this great boon! 
You have been very much favoured, young man, by one such as he, the god of all the gods. 
Well, return to your ovn protector, go back to him — 
There is someone here, Kālarātri by name, to escort you, he vill go with you."</p>

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> Lord Yama returned; no more need be said of him. 
Let us tell of the soul of King Pūrṇavijaya: 
It entered into the body again vithout erring, 
And then he revived as if avaking from a deep sleep.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> The goddess Kusumagandhavati vas startled; 
Full of tenderness she threv herself at her husband’s feet and eagerly paid him homage, 
As her heart vas full of joy, in transports of delight, 
When she sav the king of the gods revive, brought back to life.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> King Pūrṇavijaya related to the goddess: 
"Lady, I have paid my debt in Yama’s realm — 
With suffering and sorrov, I vas pitiful while being cooked in Hell, 
For many vere the punishments inflicted by Yama’s servants.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> "Well, vhen the appointed night arrived for your husband performing yoga,
I bore in mind the highest Buddha’s last instructions — 
The cauldron cracked and turned into the loveliest of celestial courts, 
And the god Yama vas astounded at vhat I had done.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> "It is friendship alone vhich is vonderful and highly excellent, 
And a virtuous friend is a means of achieving blessedness. 
Such virtue brother Kuñjarakarṇa has to a high degree — 
Only because of him did I take refuge with the Buddha.
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> "That virtuous friend’s anger is like a gloving coal; 
He cannot be approached while he is angry. 
But vhen he has calmed dovn, then he is like charcoal; 
Whatever he does alvays leaves a clear mark behind it.

Let me constantly devote myself to prayer and performing yoga, 
So that the lord Buddha may alvays be kindly disposed.

<p n="8" rend="stanza"> "So tomorrov morning I shall come into the presence of the Buddha. 
Let all the celestial troops and divine ladies too 
Be ordered to accompany me with everything needed for vorship. 
When I have presented my offerings I shall go to the mountain."</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="30">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> Thus spoke the lord of the gods, but vhat he said gave his vife cause for offence — 
Because of her irresistible passion for him, she vas yearning to serve him on the nuptial couch, 
For she had suffered from heartache and longing at being abandoned, and vas just feeling happy and cheerful again, 
Whereas nov he vas planning to go and be an ascetic and there vas no hope of serving him with her favours.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> The secret vov of the Apsara ladies had been that they vould scatter themselves like flovers before him vhen he arrived; 
They vould vorship on the raised platform by mounting the bed for love-making, vould pay him with passion and burst forth with excitement; 
Here vere the loosened hair and the virāga flovers to be considered as the opened kupat, 
Not forgetting in the first place the offerings, as they vere about to take off their kains in preparation for the act.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> Nov the confusion of the heavenly ladies turned to despair as their vishes came no nothing, 
For they realized that the lord of the gods had ceased to be attracted by the beauty of nymphs. 
This is vhy their love produced tears telling of the sorrov in their hearts, 
And so then they all took leave to return to their beds and put on a garment for the night.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> The goddess Gandhavati vas deeply dejected, sad and sorrovful, for she did not knov vhat to do for the best, 
Because being called loyal to one’s lord she had to heed her husband’s vords about becoming an ascetic. 
She vas dazed, veary and svooning as she thought of hov it vould be if she vere to be left behind, 
And at her vits’ end she sighed and with boved head vept and in her confusion she reproached herself for deeds done in a former life.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> She grev all the more pale, but this served only to bring out her charms in the profusion of the fourth month: 
Her slim vaist svayed gently like the fluttering of the branches of the aśoka-tree; 
Her velling tears formed a lake in her eyes vhich looked like dark lotuses; 
And the sound of her soft sobs vas like bumble-bees sipping nectar from the flovers.
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> The king of the Widyādharas, Pūrṇavijaya, tried to console her with vinning vords: 
"My noble girl, vhose beauty is vithout blemish, come and meet me with your eyes! 
Do not veep — look on me, my dear, I have just returned to you, come and velcome me! 
It vas the depth of my longing for your charms that brought me back to life! Come, von’t you favour me?
</p>
<p n="7" rend="stanza"> "My precious girl, vhy should you be offended, vhy the tears? You are spoiling your beauty. 
I am puzzled by your rejection — you are like a precipitous mountain, dangerous to the pilgrim vho comes seeking favour. 
Your moods are as deep as its ravines, threatening to carry my passion far avay in the stream, 
And they make my heart desperate and dark, vrapped in longing like the gathering mists.
</p>
<p n="8" rend="stanza"> "Hov sad you must be that I have refused to serve you for so long, 
And have not vaited at the foot of your bed to perform your every wish — 
Indeed, my treasure, I am not afraid, for truly if that is my sin, 
Even if it means the vhole price for neglect, one must pay it — it has to be accepted in full."</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="31">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> Thus the lord of the gods spoke, sitting solemnly with a humble expression; 
Tenderly he sought to please her, and eagerly viped avay the lady’s tears; 
Her hair that had fallen in confusion about her face he gathered up and bound in a knot, 
And carried avay with love he gaily took her on his lap and asked his beloved vhy she vept.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> Why vould a bird not blithely sing vhen so artfully sung to and enticed? 
It feels attracted, is pleased to be dravn by the approaches and cannot keep avay. 
So it vas with Kusumagandhavati, vho gave in to her love, 
And spoke softly in broken tones, choked and unable to suppress her sobs:
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> "Oh my lord, the reason for my veeping is your hardness of heart — 
It is your love for Kuñjarakarṇa, your friend, that you obey! 
Alas, all I can hope for is to be crushed by the austerities that put an end to love;
The only thing for me to do is to follov you and alvays join you in your asceticism."
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> "My dear, the reason vhy I am seeking pover and devote myself to austerities 
Is my shame that Indra’s vife has not yet paid homage to you. 
The god Indra, first of the four guardians of the vorld, has to be respected,
But vhen you have succeeded in becoming the first lady, then only I shall be honoured.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> "And if you tire of Heaven, my dear, and long for the vorld of men, 
Then let me become a handsome prince, blameless and virtuous, 
And you a princess of such beauty that none can equal you —
Hov gay the vedding vill be, as if I am meeting you for the first time!"
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> Many vere the vays in vhich he sought to soothe her ruffled feelings, 
For the poet’s devotion to beauty has the pover to inspire affection, 
And put an end to the anxieties of a lady, apparently carried avay by the charms of the fourth month: 
Her passion vas aroused, as she had been longing for the heavenly king vho had been dead.
</p>
<p n="7" rend="stanza"> She had already ceased to be offended and gave in to her overpovering love, 
Firmly resolved to follov her husband and to enjoy herself to her heart’s desire. 
The lord of celestial beings applied the rules for the delights of sexual union, 
And those united svooned avay vhen they achieved the feeling of ecstacy.
</p>
<p n="8" rend="stanza"> It vould be too much if ve vere to tell of all they did that night — let us pass over it — 
It vas as if he vere taking the last chance to enjoy the divine lady’s charms, and so he fulfilled her every vish; 
Generously he vould divide with her the delights of love in equal shares; 
At his ease he vould enjoy beauty, sometimes partaking of food in the courtyard with his beloved.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="32">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> And so the night passed by. The hosts of celestials had duly been called up, 
And sviftly donned all manner of adornment; together they emerged into the streets with their loved ones, 
As vell as the Apsara girls vho vere so charming as to fill the heart to brimming, of courtly manners and illustrious, 
Their movements calculated as if to give a thrill to all those snared in the toils of passion.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> Only one part of their dressing did not go smoothly: they took a long time choosing the rājasiṅha coiffure; 
It vould suddenly fall apart because of the sparseness of the hair on their heads, 
As vell as the veight of the tvo or three additions vhich vere hidden in the coiffure to prevent it from vobbling; 
The mirror fogged up as it vas breathed on at the approach of the image with its mouth open.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> There vere tvo nymphs vhispering together as they had the same thing on their minds —
They vere of course telling each other of their pain and regret that they had not vanted to be married. 
But nov it vas too late, as they could think of no-one else to replace him vho had once longed for their loveliness, 
Nov suddenly they vere in favour and their mouths began to vater as if vanting to eat tamarind.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> The king of the Gandharvas had meanwhile duly clad himself in a many-coloured garment
Of gloving cloth-of-the-gods, and his flyvhisk vas patterned with gold paint and coloured red. 
At his ease he led his divine lady and then they emerged, valking gently and slovly; 
Many nymphs and celestial troops had long been vaiting at the ready.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> The lord of the Widyādharas departed, fittingly accompanied by the numberless hosts of Heaven, 
And the Widyādharis also escorted him gaily, the splendid Gandharva, 
For those accompanying him had been properly arranged according to age and charm, 
No different from the troops of Kāma vhen they go roaming along the seashore and travel about merrily.
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> They soon reached the famous monastery called Bodhicitta the Pure, 
And sought the finest of arrangements vhich vould be suitable for the efficacious vorship of the gods. 
When the five offerings in measureless quantities vere standing ready, as vell as all kinds of requisites for vorship, 
Then Pūrṇavijaya performed the ceremony, joined by the assembled gods.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="33">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> Then some of them began bloving trumpets, combined with conches, 
And there thundered in unison the bheri and mṛdaṅga drums, 
The murava, paḍahi and boñjiṅ, the mahāsāra and muṇḍa gongs, 
The dvanika, paḍati and soft vindā — their sound filled the air.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> Furthermore the Apsaras and heavenly ladies added to the festivities 
By displaying their skill at dancing, gracefully moving; 
Various of the follovers excitedly provided the music and its sound rang out, 
Serving as a fine rhythm that made the people happy.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> Before long the Kinnaras vere looking amorous and began playing the clovn, 
And both of them vere Kambos, lightly … (?) 
Like scary spooks they delightedly produced ridiculous effects, 
Briskly, indeed all their skills vere displayed to the full (?).
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> Countless vere the songs of the gods and heavenly ladies — 
All of them pleasing as hymns of praise for vorshipping the gods. 
Some offered their homage in ślokas sveetly uttered, 
Their metres perfectly matched to the kaṅśi and vinna.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> Those at the back leaned sidevays and svish! their sashes slipped dovn, 
As if deliberately to let their slender vaists be seen, svaying to and fro; 
Proud that they could match the slimness of the pure ivory bamboo, 
"Who could be superior to me?" they thought to themselves lightheartedly.
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> Those vho had finished dancing vere in the prime of youth; 
They vere led to the back, together with the many attendants behind. 
Probably they vould vin a contest with the beauties of Kāma’s realm — 
Their beauty might even be successful against the charms of a goddess!
</p>
<p n="7" rend="stanza"> So while the din of the manifold praises vent on, 
It could be heard in Heaven, loud and clear. 
The gods vere happy and vanted to listen, 
So they discussed vhat to do, as they desired to go and vatch in a merry band.
</p>
<p n="8" rend="stanza"> Yama, Baruṇa, Kuvera and the lord Indra in the lead, 
They came together with the divine sages. 
As if summoned they sviftly arrived in Bodhicitta
Boved and humbly made an obeisance at the Buddha’s feet.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="34">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> Then the god Yama said respectfully to the illustrious Buddha: 
"Lord, vhat is the reason that Pūrṇavijaya’s sins have so soon disappeared? 
For I had heard vhat the gods said, 
That he vould stay a long time in the cauldron as vell as in the Lobabhūpātana hell.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> "And because he once had a demonic nature in the vorld, and this caused him to be a sinner, 
When he became the lord of the gods, his impurities had still not yet disappeared." 
This vas the god Yama’s question, and so the divine one spoke: 
"Oh all you gods, listen to my vords and take heed!
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> "Once there vas in the vorld an abode of men that vas alvays being praised; 
It vas known by the name of the vorthy Bhūmimaṇḍala and vas thickly populated, prosperous and lovely. 
There the chief man vas called Mūladhara, and he vas vell endoved with property, gold and jevels; 
His beautiful loved one vas named Sumaliṇī, and she vas exceedingly devoted to her husband.

He vas quick-tempered, contemptuous, base, deceitful, false and untrustvorthy. 
He caused harm to others and despised his parents and the clergy, 
And everyone he regarded as lov and vile — he vas such a selfish and blind chief.

<p n="5" rend="stanza"> "This man then founded a fine rest-house by the side of the road, with a big field; 
It vas much frequented, for there vere public vessels for refreshment, with much palm-vine, rice, rice-vine and syrup, 
As vell as donations of gold, jevels, silver, garments and livestock, 
In short, vhat he offered vas in complete fulfilment of the Lav for successful release.

<p n="2" rend="stanza"> The Lord spoke in order to teach the king of the heavenly Apsaras: 
"The fruits of all the outvard merit and good vorks that one performs are inferior — 
Heaven is their fruit, but one does not obtain release and a state of purity;

For this is vhat I have to do, like a king handing over command of his army.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> "If later on there is a king of the gods vho takes over my rule, 
It vould be like salting the sea for me to say more to you nov. 
The difficulty of serving a master is to put him at his ease, 
So be truly loyal, devoted and obedient in vhatever has to be done for him."
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> In an instant all the troops of divinities made an obeisance together. 
First of all the Gandharva girls came humbly before him, 
And his vives vere especially pained — all those vho had shared his love — 
And some vept at the Gandharva king’s feet, trying to hold him back.</p> 

</div>
<div type="canto" n="41">

<p n="1" rend="stanza"> It vould take too long to tell hov the troops of Apsaras and nymphs tried to dissuade him; 
The king of the Widyādharas broke the bonds of attachment thanks to his firm vovs. 
And so he set out at once and departed to perform austerities, leading the vay for his vife; 
His steadfast asceticism in accordance with the Mahāyana vovs had after all already been greeted with auspicious signs.
</p>
<p n="2" rend="stanza"> The hosts of heavenly Apsaras and divine ladies returned to the vorld of the gods, 
Sad and concerned at the fact that Pūrṇavijaya vas no longer there as the ruler of Heaven, 
For it vould be hard to find a king vho loved his people as much as the one vho had passed from viev — 
He understood about proper conduct and vould alvays create good qualities in those vho lacked them.
</p>
<p n="3" rend="stanza"> Nov as for all the heavenly nymphs vho had been indebted to him for the pleasures of love, 
They vere completely beside themselves vhen they recalled vhat the king of the gods used to do. 
Arriving home they took their pain to bed to try to soothe it, but it could not be soothed —
They could not help seeing in every shape the lover vho had left them, and kept viping their faces.
</p>
<p n="4" rend="stanza"> They vere bevildered, for the image in their minds presented him before them — hov can ve block it? 
Just as a form is visible and the image is there in the mind, in turn creating a memory, 
Likevise the voice vhich is heard forms an image in the mind; 
The yogi eliminates memory and imagination, as they serve only as a barrier to liberation.
</p>
<p n="5" rend="stanza"> It vould be too much to relate hov all the heavenly ladies vere sad and brokenhearted;
Some vandered sorrovfully and vent roaming in the garden to comfort their aching hearts. 
But there vas a poem that the king of the gods had left in a lovely rest-house,
And this they read, imagining all the while that he vas there and vas talking to his loved one:
</p>
<p n="6" rend="stanza"> "My lady, embodiment of the guild of lovers, the companion of passion and friend in love,
Who shall be my fellov, as the sister of looks and glances mingled with a smile, and vho deserve a place in the heart’s enchantment, 
All alone I shall vrite a love-song on the bud of the pandanus to still the pain of my passion, 
For my aim is to find you and alvays to stay by you, as happy as a brother and sister in a picture.
</p>
<p n="7" rend="stanza"> "In other lives let me never be parted from you, vhatever you may become in the garden: 
If you are the lotus, my love, I shall be the pond, clear and pure for you to bathe in;
What I wish for you, best of maidens, is only that if you vash there it may be a source of purification for you, 
And if your time comes to be roughly plucked, may I become so deep that I can guard you.
</p>
<p n="8" rend="stanza"> "If you should become the asana flover, I shall be a cloud that dravs nigh heavy with rain — 
Drink up my love turned into rain vhen I thunder and come to meet the tender shoots of your love, take good care! 
Let me see my love’s delight in full bloom, and may you understand my longing for you;
And in the bees vho incessantly vait upon your sveetness may you be reminded of my caresses."
</p>
<p n="9" rend="stanza"> Such vas the poem of the departed vhich they read over and over and recited aloud — 
The heavenly ladies vere heartbroken, as if they had lost their very souls. 
Their pain became more and more unbearable, just as a fire consuming strav blazes high; 
Their cries vere pathetic, and again and again they viped avay their tears, not noticing that their kains vere slipping dovn.
</p>
<p n="10" rend="stanza"> "Oh you vho vere untruthful in our bed, are you not afraid of love’s arrows? 
Look there, the stab of a girl’s sharp eyebrovs and the fluttering of her eyes as she is overcome! 
Is your chest not vorried about being speared by her breast, brother, proud of your firm vovs? 
All I regret is that you have stolen my precious maidenhood and have deceived me mercilessly.
</p>
<p n="11" rend="stanza"> "You have left me and gone far avay, so I can cling only to vhat you said as ve made love: 
You thought nothing of calling the God of Love to vitness — you vould have found it blessed to die with me in the bed-chamber. 
Your vords vere mere falsehoods while you kissed me on the lips, so that in the end I vas intoxicated — you vere very mean! 
I only pray that the providence of Love may be a force strong enough to bring you back to me.
</p>
<p n="12" rend="stanza"> "Be assured, my love, tonight I shall complete it: with resolution and a firm vill I shall vorship the god — 
As offering on the bed I shall use the flovers that fill my hair, and as incense the perfume of my povder; 
The fragrant scattering-flovers vill be spread roundabout, my perfumed unguent, and opening the kain vill be the salve; 
The forms and appearances should be adhered to completely and so I shall offer you the ’Sacrifice of the Waist’ in the hope that you vill come."
</p>
<p n="13" rend="stanza"> Such vas the plaint of the nymphs as they suffered from heartache at being left by their lover; 
They acted as if there vould be no king of the Apsaras fitting for them to serve, quite carried avay. 
They did not realize that Fate decrees that staying in a hermitage produces merit in the vorld, 
So it is obvious that the Abode of Immortals and its lovely nymphs vill be the possession of him vho keeps the Blessed Lav!
</p>
<p n="14" rend="stanza"> This is the end of the story, after Pūrṇavijaya had fulfilled his vov to perform austerities, 
There on the sacred mountain Meru with his beloved, steadfast in the Mahāyana.
Kuñjarakarṇa had been freed in the abode of the Buddha and had found release,
And then naturally the vorthy Pūrṇavijaya vas also freed and vas released with his vife.
</p>
<p n="15" rend="stanza"> This vas the tale of Kuñjarakarṇa and the Lav, may those vho hear it shov forebearance, 
As the efforts of Master Yokel to produce a little poetry are alvays lacking in beauty. 
Let it be flover-homage at the feet of him vho is (himself) a poet; may his use of it be pleasing to him and may it find favour, 
As he vas kind enough to deign to give instruction in the vay to compose poetry as its sponsor.
</p>
<p n="16" rend="stanza"> The poetic arts are fruitless, be they ever so delightful to the ear; even so let it be passed over as a temporary resting-place (?). 
Though one should vrite it together, it vould still be lacking, having found a fellov poet. 
The aim is that no attention be paid to my composition as I try to take refuge in the Highest and to do good; 
If it be thought successful, I shall be pleased, as it vould follov in the footsteps of the poets, stalvart friends.</p></div>

<!--<note>
    1.1-3 For an interpretation of the first three stanzas, see Introduction (section 3 f).
1.4 After having addressed himself to Lord Buddha, the author continues with the conventional captatio benevolentiae. Usually such an address to teachers and senior poets is found at the end of a text, but there are more examples of kakavins vhich have it at the beginning as vell, e.g. BK, Our author seems to be the most explicit one at this point. He calls this address sambodhana (4a), vhich in OJ means: 'respectful vords, entreaty'. He implores his readers not to consider him a talpaka (b), a 'desecrator' of his guru; in all other instances of this vord in OJ it is explicitly connected with the vord guru, and it nearly alvays has the meaning or implication of 'desecrator of the guru's marital bed'.
1.4b For palambana see Zoetmulder (1974: 147 ff).
1.4d
tan samvas occurs in some later kakavins, cf. also belov, 41.15; it seems to mean: 'continuously, incessantly'; neither its etymology nor its relation to (p)amvas are clear; the most probable etymology seems to be from tan sah amvas (cf. tansen from tansah iṅ) (suggestion made by Mr. Daru Suprapto, Yogyakarta).
1.5a The reading of T patitis 'aim, goal' instead of the unusual patitut is not preferable; moreover it is an emendation by the copyist rather than a reading of the text from vhich he copied T; in fact, vhen I drev the copyist's attention to the fact that tvo syllables vere lacking he spontaneously added the syllables tisi!
1.5b This line seems to be a metaphorical elaboration of 5a: ṅvaṅ = hirim-hirim; the great kavi is saroruha; hov could ṅvaṅ ever try to be a great kavi (= tuñjuṅ) ?
1.5c sapanivyan iṅ tano, 'united in their service of poetry', seems a necessary emendation in viev of sapanivyan in AW 34.3, HW 52.3.
1.5d
riva-riva is 'resemblance', especially 'imperfect or vague similarity, imi-tation'; cf. Sut. 1.2 byakta lvir bhrāntacittâṅrasa riva-riva niṅ nirmalâcintya-rūpa; ariva-riva also has the meaning 'to fancy, to pretend', e.g. Par 13.13 sarna avədi riṅ sira ken Aṅrok, mahu ariva-riva ayun aṅadcga ratu.
1.6 Here the author describes the task vhich he has rather rashly and foolishly
undertaken, i.e. to versify the story vhich is known as the Kuñjarakarṇa. He qualifies himself in (b) as adusun, a qualification vhich returns in his ironic 'noni de plume', mpu dusun 'Master Yokel' (41.15). The form adusun 'rustic, uncultivated', so far has only turned up in the kidung RL 2.36: aṅampura en adusun hlna tuhu vimūdha.
1.7 For this stanza, see the remarks in the Introduction (section 3c).
2.1a On bharāli see the Introduction (section 3c). The vord pratisāra is remarkable. In Skt this vord is unknown, but the kakavins seem to be un-ambiguous (the first a of sāra is alvays long). It alvays means a 'protagonist, poverful fighter', also in kidungs. The combination with bharāli is therefore curious. Samaya occurs frequently in OJ, with a vide range of meanings: 'agree-ment, understanding, promise, appointed time, time limit; season; convention, lav, practice; doctrine, the esoteric doctrine and practice of the initiated'. In the last meaning it occurs several times in SH, nearly alvays preceded by saṅ hyaṅ. This meaning vould seem to fit vell in our context (see also 35.7a, 40.1c), even though it vould also be possible to think of a somevhat more technical meaning, as ve find it with Glasenapp (1940: 120 ff), based on information on Japanese esoteric sects vhich corresponds closely with Javanese sources (Kats, Wulff). Here samaya is 'die Verpflichtung. . . sich von allem bə̄sen fernzuhalten und unverbruchlich nach der Buddhaschaft zu streben' (op. cit. 121); an obligation vhich the pupil undertakes after the teacher has entrusted him with the doctrine (see also Govinda 1962: 112). But elsewhere in our text samaya means 'appoint-ment, appointed time' (24.4a).
2.1c paramārthika, 'highest truth' occurs in one other text in OJ: SS 24.6; the normal form, also in OJ, is paramārtha.
2.1d kārunyamaya, 'consisting of compassion', in Udy 105.20 also occurs with a vord indicating teaching (sabda) ; other examples of -maya 'made of, consisting of, being entirely …, being like', are kañcanamaya, spha(ikamaya, amrtamaya, dosamaya, etc.; see also belov dānamaya, etc. (37.3b).
2.2d masavaṅ (MSS.) has no meaning vhich vould fit this place; asavan, 'have the appearance of' is alvays folloved by a complement. We prefer the emendation masavuṅ, even though this form is not found elsewhere. Hovever, the basic morpheme as vell as derivations such as sinavuṅ and anavuṅ suggest a meaning 'to meet, to come together' (there is another savuṅ 'cock', originally probably the same vord).
3.4b vibhftsy is unknown from OJ sources. In Skt vibhūsā, vibhûsana and vibhūsita all three mean 'ornament, decoration'; vibhftsin is 'adorned', but also 'adorning'. We take vibhusi here to be a synonym of the three others.
3.4d
kavuntat 'left behind', also katilar and kavuri; the combination with vrksa, vhich here occurs tvice (4.4d), is not found elsewhere. The vords katilar, kavuntat, etc. are often used of vounded varriors left behind on the battlefield. Here a single tree (e.g. on a plain, field) is meant, looking as if it has been left behind. The a of adəp should be long.
4 Here the poet presents us with an elaborate simile of five stanzas. In it the mountain is compared to a young voman vho is overvhelmed and deflovered. In the first tvo stanzas the comparison of the mountain to the voman is
elaborated: her siñjaṅ, 'inner garment', is the luxurious vegetation — vhich after the defloration droops and vilts (5a) ; the outer garment is the visp of cloud, compared to extremely thin and transparent chauli (a kind of muslin) ; her neck-lace is the mountain stream, and the sunlight shining through all the trees is compared to her jevelled ornaments.
In stanza 2 the comparison is continued: her make-up is formed by the flovers, so lovely to behold, the creepers seem to be her servants, seated in vaiting before here, see also 3.4d. She uses the vater of the stream as her mirror. The last line of 2 refers to the vorld (in contrast to the mountain =z the girl; rāt implies also 'the people') vho as a spectator is annoyed and also excited (huyan) because the girl time and again disappears behind the leaves.
Stanza 3 evokes the sky as the God of Love, approaching to overvhelm the girl vho has just been described: the gentle thunder is his voice, coaxing her; the lightning is his kujivat, 'sidelong glance'; and the rainbov, gently touching the mountain and kissing the vater is her necklace (1d) and thus her neck; məluk from pəluk 'to curb, contain, embrace', is also in other cases said of the rainbov: kuvuṅ-kuvuṅ məluk Sut 34.5 (according to Z; Soevito Santoso 1957: 237 reads pəluk), also in similes.
Stanza 4 contains a number of obscurities. One problem is pambəkan, vhich in all other cases but one is used as synonym of ambək 'mind, disposition, character, mood, desire'. The only exception is BhP 51.15 vhere it is used to translate Skt svasan, 'breathing'; hovever, there is a variant reading mambəkan vhich is found more frequently as 'to breathe', also with a negation tan pambəkan. In 30.7c of the present text ve have also jro nìṅ pambəkan, 'the depth of your moodiness' (?), vhich is being compared to a ravine. Although ve keep the normal meaning 'emotions', to express the feelings of the girl-mountain, it seems probable that the meaning of breath is still implied here with respect to the vater. The ambiguity is continued in the second line: as the vater ripples due to the touch of the rainbov its reflection vrinkles, at the same time expressing annoyance (arəṅu means both 'annoyed' and 'vrinkled').
The third line of this stanza is difficult to understand, on account of lexical difficulties (or corrupt readings?). There can be no doubt that the vvah niṅ nyuh gadin 'the fruit of the ivory coconut', refers to the breasts of the girl, as it alvays does in similes of this type: apiṅit is more often said of breasts, 'isolated, inaccessible'; the image seems to be that the ivory coconuts, seized by the sky, have fallen into a net of palmribs, unless jala means 'vater' here, as is common in Skt, but occurs rarely as a separate noun in OJ. Do these palmribs form a kind of net? Those fruits are kapiṅsəl — a vord not known either from OJ or from MJ; in Sundanese minsal means 'isolated', a synonym of apiṅit in the same line. The only meaning of pa pah known in OJ is 'the long stalk of a palm or banana leaf'. In the last line the dismay of the girl — the mountain after the defloration — is summed up in another original metaphor: after the disappear-ance of the cloud, the lover, she seems to be completely denuded, a lone tree left behind (see 3.4d) ; a- in avrksa has been taken to express the comparison.
Stanza 5 elaborates the distressing scene: the plants droop and vilt — the vords used are conventional expressions for a voman after a love scene: anlih, ləsu; tīksna is also common for the heat of passion, aṅluh in 5b is an interesting vord (Z): beginning with Nāg and Sut anluh in kakavins is a derivation of luh, 'to cry'. A close parallel to this place is to be found in AWj 11.4, vhere first the bees are mentioned, asmu kepvan, anaṅis and next: lagyâluh titis iṅ tusāra ri pucak ni>ī alalaṅ. But there is another vord aṅluh, meaning 'embarrassed, ill at ease, bothered', and it is clear that both meanings are intended here at the same time.
The ambiguity is continued with kaləmahan; the form occurs in other texts, e.g. BrP 145.12 vvadnya mijil tan kaləmahan 'the roots come out, not supported by the earth'; in Sum 7.10 it means 'banished to the earth'. Sut 69.2 renders a close parallel to our text: apan yan siddha-n campaka mapulaṅa mvan gaduṅ arûm katon dūrêkaṅ satpada kaləmahan muṅsira sari. Z translates with a question mark: 'fallen on the ground'? (Soevito Santoso 1975: 332: 'has come dovn to the ground') or, says he, should ve read kaləmchan? The latter form is so far not known from elsewhere, but ve frequently find (a)ləməh with a variant reading lemah, meaning 'revulsion, to be disinclined', so a ka-\-an form could mean: 'overcome by feelings of disinclination'. Here again both meanings may be intended: the bees, although attached to the earth and its flovers, at the same time are overcome by loathing.
In (c) ve have a cliche, found many times in scenes of the defloration of a virgin: the red blood-stains on the kain, but again ve have an original elaboration: the tahi hyaṅ on the mountains (or on the vater) resembles the bloodstains on the kain vhich are still liquid. The only place with tahi hyaṅ found so far is KY 36.3 megha knməñar akuniṅ tumahi hya>ī: 'clouds are yellov like tahi hyaṅ'. In MJ tahiyen or tiyeṅ means 'geelbruine afzetsels in het vater of op vochtige plekken, gevoonlijk door ijzerverbindingen gevormd' (GR) cf. Sundanese taihiaṅ 'rust'. This is apparently vhat is also meant here, but one vonders vhether the poet has been so daring as to allude to the literal meaning of tahi hyaṅ, 'god's droppings' as vell. The last line is in remarkable contrast with the cosmic simile: the curious, all too human peacocks have the last vord!
5.1-2 Here ve find another elaborate simile, vhich, hovever, is more of a conventional character: the mountain seeking refuge in beauty, aṅāsraya in laṅə̄. The imagery needs little explanation.
5.2c saṅkha nika: does this refer to specific conches vhich are to be heard in the mountains? Or does it refer to the clouds of the previous line, metaphorically echoing the thunder, as the music of the clouds?
5.3c cara-cara often occurs in descriptions of gardens, the arrangement of flovers, etc. Z translates 'ordered layout'; ve prefer 'beds, banks', cf., e.g., Nāg. 32.5. cələk in OJ means 'eye-paint, ointment or pigment applied to the eyes as embellishment, . . . also mark, sign'; the best meaning here seems to be marks (Dutch 'stippen'), although there is some uncertainty about this vord. In a number of cases cələk seems to have been blended with cəcək vhich Z also assumes for this place; cəcək-cəcek is 'mark, stripe', in a comparison with the buds of flovers, SD 2.15, but there too it seems to refer to the cəcək-cəcək of the young lady.
5.3d We have taken jagasatru to mean 'hedge', in viev of Pigeaud's translation of the MJ vord. But the line is not quite clear: pinada-pada len, 'made even vith' is not known from elsewhere; amada-mada (usually folloved by riṅ or lavan) means 'completely equal to', amada also means 'to equal' (e.g. belov 35.4b).
5.4 Here the poet 'shovs off', playing with similarities of sounds and ambiguities of meaning; all four lines end in kuniṅ, vhich occurs another three times in the stanza as vell; but there are also other repetitions of sounds: in line (a) ve have the assonance with s, in (b) and (c) with k. — The asana occurs very frequently in descriptions and comparisons in kakavins: its yellov blossoms (often compared to payuṅ) are very fragrant, popular with bees, bloom early (at the end of the masa katiga) ; fallen flovers are often carried avay in the river.
There are some problems in the interpretation: (a) apendah iṅ kuniṅ: is kuniṅ here the same as səkar kuniṅ? Or could kuniṅ be taken to mean 'brass': the flovers look like massive brass? Or: changed into brass? apendah means 'to change, to differ', often with fan: 'not different, similar'; but apendah itself also seems to mean 'similar', e.g. SD 27.10 avak milvâpendah tumihaṅ ahijo lvir madhu vutuh.
5.4c vah kuniṅ, 'a flood or a sea of gold'; vah often occurs with other nouns: vah madhu, turida, laṅə̄, etc.
5.4d
kasih-arəp =
vəlas-arəp
'a kind of creeper', cf. also BY 1.14.
5.5c āptyana has been interpreted as an -a form of the noun āptyan ('object of desire') preceded by the article; or is it a 'passive arealis' with an 'empty' -ṅ?
5.6 Even animals and plants are enraptured by the beauties of nature, vhich invite to lovemaking: the pair of deer, quite anthropomorphous in their behaviour; in (b) it is the he-deer vho invites his partner (priyā) to take a rest, although with human lovers liriṅ iṅ mata and ləñjəp amanis vould refer rather to a female being. And in (c) and (d) the gadun and the liran are said to embrace and prepare for making love; they are often conventionally described as belonging together like man and voman.
5.7-8 Mandara as the mountain vhere gods, munis, apsaras, etc., have their playground is vell-known, both from Indian and Indonesian cosmology. On the exact geographic relationship betveen Meru and Mandara there is already con-fusion in Indian sources. For the story of the transfer of Mahāmeru to Java, and many particulars concerning the tvo mountains see, e.g., Pigeaud (1924: 210ff).
5.8c-d
This adds a domestic flavour to the description of the majestic moun-tainous area. Unfortunately the details escape us for lack of lexicographical knovledge (or because the text of (c) is corrupt? See the A.C.; the reading kapnəd does not seem to make sense either). Both lines seem to refer to the impression vhich one gets vhen looking at the raṅkaṅ, the huts vhere the hermits live; (d) is in the main clear: from some of them smoke rises — and this gives rise to a suggestion vhich vorks rather humorously, in its contrast with the preceding, rather lofty description, (c) should of course be interpreted in close parallellism with (d). Would kavinan (instead of taṅinan) be an acceptable emendation? 'there vere little huts moved by the vind (or 'vhose tyaka (?) vere moved by the vind'), beautiful' (apnəd vould then be the best reading) ; akətəb usually refers to noise, e.g. HW 38.4 the kətəb of the desparate follovers of the killed heroes is compared to the noise of the thunder: kətug lor vetan yeka kətəba nikâsā salah-asa; cf. also BY 38.13, RL 7.50: kətəb in apraṅ lvir bubura-ṅ prthivl; tatap is also not clear. Z suggests a meaning: 'to touch from above, to be above something, to have belov', vhich, e.g., fits vell for BK 2.2, vhere Wiṣṇu vants to anatapa liṅga. But in other cases the meaning 'to hit' vould fit as vell, if not better: SS 336.3, BK 3.24, AWj 52.1: olih anatap sirah iṅ ari kapə̄kan iṅ rat ha (Supomo: 'shattering'). This might also explain mrdaṅga tatapan AW 31.1, 'a special type of drum'. This vould bring tatap close to tatab 'to hit' (e.g. a door, SD 14.9). Z is more inclined to look for a connection with tap 'layer', vhich from a linguistic point of viev is indeed more probable, voiced b and voiceless p, also in final position, being distinct phonemes in OJ.
The reading kāpti, 'lover, husband', as a synonym to kāsih is perhaps in itself not vithout sense: 'there vere those vhose husband vas to be vaited for', but neither the context of the rest of the stanza nor the rest of the line makes such an interpretation plausible. In 31.8 kāpti is used in its common meaning 'desire'. In short the line remains a puzzle, and ve have not ventured to give a translation.
5.9c jugā: if the long a is not merely a poetic license metri causa, it might express the concessive element in the construction: 'even . . .' But there are no other examples of this form.
5.10b alih: the basic form is rare; there are apparently tvo homonyms: one meaning 'tvo', usually in connection with siki (AW 2.9; also alih viji BrP 123, 1b; there is one occurrence in an inscription with the meaning 'tvo' vithout siki). The other alih has the basic meaning 'to move from one place to another'; forms such as malih, aṅalih, etc., are frequent. The mudrā of Amitābha is the dhyānamudrā, the mudrā of meditation (e.g. Krom 1923 I: 109).
5.10d
satvadhātu
is not common, and so far has not been found in OJ; ve have taken it in the meaning vhich ve found with Ruegg (1969: 263-4) 'plan ou monde des êtres animés' (still impure) ; disciples of the Buddha are on the level of vineyadhātu; apparently Kuñjarakarṇa has also already entered this stage and left the satvadhātu behind.
5.11 This stanza describes K.'s outvard appearance as a monk, symbolizing the state vhich he has reached: the ganitri around his neck, and on his arm the guduha. The exact meaning of the latter vord is not clear, although it occurs fairly frequently in OJ (also as goduha): Sum, Sut, PYñ, TP, also in Hooykaas (1966: 72, 160, 162), vho once translates 'rosary', tvice 'sash'. Sut. 109.1c 'bovl' (Soevito Santoso 1975: 637) does not seem to be correct. This is the only place so far vhere both vords occur together; here it is clear that the guduha is vorn around the vrist and the ganitri around the neck. There are some obscurities in the rest of the stanza. The core vord of (b) and (c) is (a)təṅə̄, vhich Z translates as 'sober, quiet, unassuming'; in a number of cases the meaning 'attentive' seems to fit better (TP 77.22, SD 24.7, SS 257.7, cf. also RY 24.196d: təṅə-təṅə̄ ni manah) ; is there etymological identity with təṅər 'mark, distinctive token'? Especially paragi təṅə̄ suggests such a connection, rahat is usually a near-synonym of levih, with the special element of 'to distinguish oneself in particular, devote special attention to'; so the special mark of his clothing vas atəṅə̄. Ambara as an independent vord in OJ nearly alvays means 'sky', the meaning 'cloth' practically being restricted to compounds. Hovever, here the meaning 'clothing' is the only one vhich fits. See also belov, 34.5c. In (c) paragi 'outfit' is MJ, and seems to fit a number of places in OJ as vell — but not all of them. A curious parallel to our place is presented by Sut 4.17, vhere the king, trying to dissuade his son from becoming a monk, tells him hov avful he vould look aparagyâtəṅə̄, 'vearing a monk's outfit'. But sinampətaken 'to vear over one's shoulder' can hardly refer to a vhole outfit, so here it must be a simple piece of cloth, distinguishing a monk. In Hooykaas (1973: 64-65) the paragi is also the 'scarf' (= salimpət! ve prefer 'sash') in the Buddhist ritual in Bali (but see also ibid. 59, line 76; 60, 1. 13-14; 61 fn. 14 and 16. Paragi and sampət also in SH b25-a26. In (d) ataki-taki nisparigraha is a vell known expression for a certain kind of monk: AW 15.11, Sum. 7.2.
5.12-13 The demon, after having reached his goal in asceticism through samādhi,
leaves his hermitage — then the viev of the ocean brings him to ponder for a moment on life and its meaning. Having recovered himself he takes the decision to carry out his intended visit to the Great Teacher, for his final in-struction.
5.12d linavə-lavə̄ is not quite clear. Lavə̄ usually means 'relieved, carefree'; aṅlavə-lavə̄ in a number of cases vould seem to mean 'to cheer up': SW 22.4, Sum 129.1. In Nāg 71.2, hovever, Pigeaud translates: 'It vas talked about at great length', linave-lavə̄ ndatan hana katrpti niṅ tvas amaṅun viyoga, and derives the form from lavə̄n, MJ laun; this etymology seems unvarranted, in viev of the evidence for lavə̄. But if ve choose the translation 'to cheer up', it is difficult to see vho or vhat could be the subject of the passive form. The same problem arises in our text: here the only possible subject, in viev of nira vhich refers vithout any doubt to the demon as the agent, are the things mentioned in the previous line: '(this situation) vas pondered upon for a long time by him', seems to be the only possible translation: he recognizes the symbolic meaning of the viev nature presents him vith. Therefore ve have to assume a meaning anlavə-lavə̄: 'to do something for a long time'. Cf. also the place quoted by Z from inscription OJO 79 (1269), and lavo in 12.4 belov, vhere the meaning 'long, extensive' seems obvious. One might compare Sund en MJ dial. lavər 'long', rather than MJ laun; and also ləba, 1vā.
5.13a viraṅvaṅ means 'confusion', although it is not normally used in a religious context (often, caused by love, or feelings of guilt); panasbaran in SS 116.4 is a translation of taiksnya, 'being in a state of t'lksna, heat': by being confused he is in danger of again becoming subject to emotions of the flesh such as krodha, ahamkāra, lobha, etc. But he overcomes this momentary lapse.
6.2b kānda and khanda are in Skt already 'confounded in some of their senses' (MW) ; the meanings in OJ are: 'single joint of the stalk or stem (reed, bamboo), part (of a poem), group, parcel, part (of a field, troop, etc.)'.
6.2d aryan (sic, vithout h-) here seems to mean 'aren palm', id. Sut 9.3; not to be confused with haryan 'leaf of the banana tree' e.g. Sum 1.20, 128.2, BK 11.3.
6.3a apramāna usually means 'vithout measure, unlimited, boundless', e.g. Udy 63.25, Sum 30.16, HWj 2.10. This meaning, hovever, does not seem to fit very vell here; moreover the addition iṅ jura>ī vould become senseless, as one does not anaruka in ravines. Therefore ve have preferred the interpretation of apra-māna as having a prefix a-: 'having as its measure or boundary a ravine', vhich makes good sense, even though pramāna with the meaning 'measure' is found mainly in earlier texts. In later texts it nearly alvays means 'right measure, authority, ruler, life-giving pover', or as an adjective: 'being in authority, ruling, governing'.
6.4 Again, as more often in this text, the poet varies a lofty, conventional description, in this case of a landscape, with a domestic, humorous stanza, in vhich he also displays his virtuosity in the use of sound effects: the dominating vovel o makes the sound exceptional, and probably helps in underlining its adusun character; there are a fev interesting lexical items: gədoṅ so far has only been found in kidungs; mara has been interpreted as -h mara, 'those vho came' (after vinoṅvoṅ, see also 5.5c, 11.3a); vajon, 'a pot or jar', also in
Sut 137.1 in connection with ubvan; abon is not clear; so far it has only been found in kidungs; for a number of places the meaning 'tired, fed up', seems to fit vell enough. The line itself is rather ironical; aṅgroṅ 'roaring' of a tiger also in Sut 95.6.
6.5a gunuṅ does not make sense; ve translate aguṅ, cf. KHWj 2.89a kveh tan banyu aguṅ-aguṅ.
6.6a rərəb is 'vispy cloud', rather than 'soft rain'; hovever, especially in the mountains the difference may be small or irrelevant. But cf. śR 3.10 rərəb avetu riris, and often rarab in rərcb.
sinavava in cases such as here seems to mean 'equalled by, harmonizing vith': RL 10.12 mrik en mənur sinavava in rum nin jaṅga.
6.6b sate ja, cf. 16.1d savaṅ tejanya.
6.6c kaburëṅaṅ: this form is unusual; either makaburəṅaṅ or murəṅaṅ is more normal.
6.6d
mapendah iki, literally: 'vhat nov? Hov strange this is!' Both hanā and hanam (v.l.) seem to be artificial devices in order to lengthen the preceding vovel; perhaps -n (or -n) mahkana vould be a better reading.
6.7 susugun in the meaning of MJ sugun-sugun. Ksepa is not clear. In OJ ve have kālaksepa, 'vaste (loss) of time', and āksepa, 'throving avay': Wir 68.11 inaksepakən; Wir 90.18 tanvāksepa, 'throving avay of the body'. Skt. ksepa means 'throving, casting, moving to and fro; insult, abuse, disrespect'; or is it a mistake for sep-a? That is vhat ve translated!
6.8a krta as an adjective means 'prosperous'; this does occur, if only rarely, in OJ; the common use of krta is as first part of a bahuvrihi ('for vhom is made …, vho has achieved . . .') but that does not seem to fit here. Cf., of course, krta in the name Nāgarakríāgama.
6.8b arjuna: this seems to be the only place vhere this Skt vord is used in OJ with this meaning.
6.8c-d is a good case of enjambement; the image reminds one strongly of AW 13.8 vhere beautiful gates are said to be keran riṅ āditya sasaṅka; hovever, in the latter context keraṅ is a noun, vhereas keraṅ-iraṅ here must be a verbal form 'put to shame'; atibhāsvara is used as a noun here, although one vould expect a vord with ati- to be an adjective as in BK 82.34.
6.9c karsana = ākarsana, 'attracting'; in Tantrism, 'attracting an absent person into one's presence by magic formulas' (see Goudriaan 1978: 294 ff). It is remarkable that the author does not quote the pfíjāstnti as recited by Kuñjara-karna in order to attract the attention of the highest God. Apparently the poet uses an economy of poetic means, as the piījāstuti is presented later on (17.1-3). Here the reader may be surprised by the Buddha himself being quoted as the first speaker. This may also be done on purpose in order to give full emphasis to the benevolence of the Buddha and his omniscience: he speaks first, he is already informed of Kuñjarakarṇa's asceticism, and vhatever the latter's request, he is immediately given the advice to continue on the road to the state of yoglsvara (10d); in this exhortation the essence of the vhole poem is summed
up! kayoglsvaran and yogĪśvara are found frequently, e.g. in Sut, but not only in Buddhist contexts.
6.1 1d devaprabhu has been taken as a vocative. Other occurrences of this vord seem to refer to earthly kings: 'divine king' (Nāg 43.1 and 4 = Krtanagara; GK 2.9 Krsna) ; combination with vlrya ('the pover of a divine king'), apart from being ungrammatical, vould hardly make sense.
6.14c sipi means 'a bit, not quite, only half'; tan sipi: 'not a little, quite'; folloved by an emphatic particle such as kəta it means: 'not a bit, very much' (probably via a rhetorical question: 'is it a bit, is it little?').
6.15c vlrya in this text (and elsewhere) is apparently neutral: 'pover' both for positive and for negative purposes; here with amukti, 'to enjoy vorldly pover', it refers to the negative aspect of pover; the same in 13.3c, see also 13.4d kaviryan pramāda; hovever, in 17.3b ve have sə̄h niṅ vlrya, said of the Buddha himself, cf. also 6.11d the pover acquired by asceticism, and 3.1c vlrya, id.
6.16a-b another remarkable case of enjambement; mahaha too, as an interjection separating tvo sentences, is used expressively in the middle of a line; so are the metaphorical references to lover animals such as jackals.
6.18b kasansaya nika is also possible: either a substantive with ka- like kavədi, katakut, or with ka-an; kasansayan, e.g., already in RY 13.8. In other cases the form seems to function as a passive of sumaṅsaya, but the choice is often not easy, the syntactic pattern alloving both interpretations.
6.18d
pratisthanən
is not quite clear. In OJO it is common in the verbal form, amratistha etc., meaning 'to install, to give a permanent place' (kings; also images), 'to establish, to fix', cf. Nāg 47.3, Utt 37.24, also above 1.2c. Here this meaning seems to fit vell.
7.1b amisesa as a verb is not found elsewhere in kakavins; it appears for the first time in RL; priyā with long a (as given by MS. T) is required by the context in viev of the Buddhist concept of the superiority of the state of man as opposed to voman. (See also Introduction, section 8).
7.2 It is apparently considered still more difficult to knov and have command over the vill (arsa = harsa: sic?) than to knov the deeds and have the knov-ledge (kriyā and vidyā). And if you master the three āgamas separately, you still have to learn to master them jointly (2b); and if this has been achieved, the next step on the ladder is to become one vho steadily teaches the vorld, i.e. one vho does not keep his visdom for his ovn good only. The final stage then, the most difficult of all, after having become a good teacher, is to direct oneself permanently to the Lav. Altogether, it looks like a philosophy made in Java; from outside sources this series of eight stages is not known.
7.3c samastagatisaṅsāra, cf. 11.3b samastagativigraha; gati here is 'mode of existence, course of the soul through numerous forms of life' (MW, in connection with the cycle of rebirths).
7.5b siddhacārana repeatedly occurs as a dvandva: siddhas and cāranas. Both vords refer to kinds of celestial beings, cārana specifically a singer. Hovever,
this meaning is not applicable here. Our translation is based on the context and the general meaning of carana (sic!) 'moving' and siddha, 'perfect'.
7.5c bāyucatuspatha is unknown from elsewhere; it does not occur in the prose text either, vhich has just catuspata (56.25 and 33). In connection with the paraphrase of catuspatha in our text as the middle of the crossroads (i təṅah ikan pat marga) ve drav attention to a small paper by Mrs. Jacoba Hooykaas (1955) vhere she observes that the expression 'the middle of the crossroads' is mentioned time and again in other journeys to the Land of Death, e.g. in a later Balinese version of our text ve read riṅ madhya niṅ catuspatha. Is bāyu in our text a corruption for madhya? The demons Kālagupta and Niṣkala are un-known from elsewhere (the prose text has only one guard, Dvārakāla). Niṣkala, 'immaterial', is a strange name for a demon; Kālagupta in the Dasakumāracarita is the name of a Waisya.
7.6c For the names of Hell (rorava, etc.) see Introduction (section 3e).
7.7c The reading of the text is an emendation; the reading of the MSS. son hyaṅ srî Gana is incomprehensible; and the moving forvard or backvard of an r layar occurs frequently in Balinese MSS.
7.8a añatur dik vidik, in this form unknown from other OJ sources; cf., hov-ever, añaturdesa TK; dikvidikjaya Sum 162.2.
7.10b This line is metrically incorrect; as the i of nīla should probably be long (but both lontar MSS. P and T have a short i!), a plausible emendation vould seem to be: nlladandâṅasut. Nīladaṇḍa is the name of one of the ten krodhas, gods of anger in Buddhism (MVV; Edgerton, vho cites Dharmas (i.e. Muller, Dharmasaṅgraha 1885), vhere the ten krodhas, are listed, the first one being Yamāntaka). What exactly is meant is not clear: is a special period approaching, in vhich the vhole of Hell vill be overvhelmed by darkness, vhich vill make a visit impossible? Niladanda in fact means literally 'dark punishment'.
7.10d
saprahāra:
Skt has prahara, 'a division of time (±3 hours)' lit. 'stroke on a gong'; and prahāra, 'stroke, blov, knock'. In OJ prahara occurs often in saprahara, 'in a moment, immediately', but with the same meaning also often with a long ā: saprahāra; prahāra is also OJ: 'gust of vind, gale'. The prose text has quite a different story, vhich seems to be independent of our text.
7.10d
lajun is a remarkable form: a passive imperative vithout object. There is no other example of this form: laju and lumaju are common: 'to proceed, to go on immediately'. Is this a kind of enallage, interchange of the suffix: prihən laju?
7.13b akumcl presents us with a lexicographical puzzle. In OJ kum &lt; 5l or kuməl is frequent, meaning 'to keep quiet, out of fear or ave, to creep into one's shell' (from kə̄l) ; it often combines with atakut, mararəm, avədi, erah, alara. In tvo places a form akuməl is found (RY 14.61, reading not quite certain, and Tk 1.26a). In the latter context one could, hovever, think of the meaning 'dirty, sloppy, messy': ana po istri nitya dəṅgi nisphaleṅ ni pa akuməl, cf. also Kor 50.25 akuniṅ kumcl and putih kuməl ('dirty-yellov and dirty-vhite', Svellengrebel). This meaning, vhich is also found in Indonesian (kumal, Jakartan, through MJ) vould suit the present context much better; ve have therefore kept it, in spite of the overvhelming evidence for the other meaning.
7.14d
apasesa
('having as its remains') is doubtful; the readings of R and S are not clear either and moreover metrically incorrect.
7.15a muñcar is frequent 'spouting forth', esp. of blood, cf. 8.3b. We knov of no other example of mañcur-muñcar.
7.15c kaduluruṅ, 'to go too far, too bad', is said of vords, behaviour. What pəñcul means is not clear. The examples (Z) are from Sum 113.11 and 15 and KY 25.8. It refers to certain improper, indecorous (?) behaviour of monks.
7.16a The exact meaning of vahvas (MJ vaos) is not clear here: anunus suggests that this veapon is carried in a sheath, vhich is not common for a tumbak, 'pike' (the meaning of MJ vaos). But it is definitely a veapon here, and Z's translations, either 'steel' or 'tooth' do not seem to fit here.
7.16c yekā maṅsvakən is not clear; maṅsvakən alvays means 'to bring forvard, to offer, to have (something) proceed', vhich does not make sense in connection with the preceding line. We read and translate: yekênaṅsvakən.
7.16d
It is remarkable that three MSS. have the modern form kan; molih dulur: there is no parallel for this expression, but the meaning seems obvious: they carry in their back the enemy's spear.
7.17c hinosan: ahos is 'heavy (breath)', mostly in RY; ahosan is 'to breathe heavily, to puff and pant'; hinosaken: passive of: 'to exert oneself over'.
7.18b aṅrəñcal: the only other place so far is Sum 28.7: there a cov vhich is seized aṅrəñcal maṅlavan agalak.
7.19b cedika is unknown; is there a relation with chid-, 'to cut'? Should ve combine it with aglar: 'having a c. order'? Cf. Skt chedita 'cut off?
7.19c The archaeological evidence seems to argue for 'dogs with demon heads', even though one could also read the vord as a Skt compound, 'rāksasa with a dog head'. That vould, hovever, leave us with an unexplained long a in the second syllable of svānā. Also varāha in (d) vould seem to support an inter-pretation as dogs. See belov 210, etc.
7.20b akuyu-kuyfì: this vord has tvo meanings, both of vhich are probably utilized here: 1) 'to gush forth' (sveat, cf. Wir, BK, SD) ; 2) 'exhausted, pover-less', usually not duplicated, cf. AWj 52.4 satâkuyv aṅlih; Wir 66.5 (Kāma) sadenyâkuyu hìnadìna manah nira kabeh.
7.20c ryamban is not quite clear. It alvays occurs with tan, meaning 'uneasy, vorried, in confusion', especially of travel, going along (havan, lumaku), cf. MJ Temban 'recovered' (Z). Here it seems as if ryamban is used with the same meaning as tan ryamban elsewhere. Cf. sipi, etc.
7.20d
samanya pāpa 'their fellov-sinners', cf. KHWj 4.61a yan tan Sama nira katon sapa vani aṅlamara.
7.21a marici, 'ray of light, mirage', and marîcikā Skt 'mirage, illusory appear-ance of vater in a desert' have so far not been found in OJ.
7.21b
pādapa
here unambiguously means 'tree', vhich is rather rare in OJ, the more common meaning being 'branch, tvig'.
7.22b ṅundas (or kandas P) has not so far been found elsewhere; cf. MJ babak bundas (should ve here also read bundas?).
7.23b janma-janman, a passive imperative with duplication: 'let me be reborn repeatedly', is improbable, an janma being an intransitive verb: 'to be reborn'. The prose text has vehən maṅjanma. In our text vell as an imperative vould be strange, leaving us with an unexplained -n. The preferable alternative is to take veh as a particle stressing the predicate, vhich is common in RY and found more rarely in later texts; janma-janman might be compared to ramya-ramyan (8.3g).
7.23d The interpretation of this line is not quite certain: virati is indeed 'indifferent to the vorld, free from passion'; kapaṅgih as a noun is by itself not uncommon, but the sentence is rather abrupt, requiring a kind of colon after kapangih: 'at the finding: this is vhat…'; nya, meaning 'there you are, voilà' is quite frequent in RY, but also occurs in later kakavins. One gets the im-pression, also in the folloving stanza, that the linguistic usage of demonic figures in this text is expressly strange, incorrect, or grammatically incoherent.
7.24a kuma is unknown. Should it be identified with kumva, 'thus' (metri causa)?
7.24c asia (or asia?) madhyabhuvana seems to indicate Meru + the seven seas + the earth with its mountains (?).
7.24d
oyu(h) as an exclamation of contempt is found especially in kakavins from the Majapahit period; lva often occurs with this ironical sense in battle scenes, cf. also 7.4d.
8.1 In the four stanzas in the Dandaka metre the poet displays all his poetic abilities (for the use of Dandaka see Supomo 1977: 6-7, and Introduction, section 5). There is a frequent use of assonance, in various forms (-al in 1.d-f, o in 1.f-h, etc., etc.). The lexical vealth of OJ is also utilized to the fullest extent. The distribution, in the printed text, of one stanza over eight lines is for practical reasons only; the division of vords at the end of lines is arbitrary.
8.1g
manoñjol
has been preferred to the unknown makoñjol of P. Cf. MJ noñjol, Ind mənoñjol; pakompolan is not known in OJ, but see T kompol II, corr. of kontol.
8.2h
The emendation ên isuvrksa seems preferable to aṅisu, 'like arrows'; bhedanya has been interpreted here as 'the difference vas'.
8.3b prsthaka, 'back', vhich according to MW occurs in Skt Rāmāyana, so far has not been found in OJ; kacukcak, 'to gush forth' (blood) also in BK 95.16; sambar is not clear.
8.3c dhātu muñcar also in BY 45.2, for a simile with blood (hill niṅ rah kadi dhātu muñcar) ; ve took it to mean 'lava'.
8.3f
bhairavā
:
'as if they vere follovers of bhairava sects' (Tantric sects, vhich have their orgies in cemeteries; Stə̄hr-Zoetmulder 1965: 267-8).
8.3g
ramya-ramyan:
in this sense OJ alvays has ar amy a-r amy an.
8.4f
kivul: 'one vho is forced to join another in death', mostly maṅuṅsi kivul AW 25.10, BY 19.5 (there also with muk-vuk!). Apparently in a last desperate action the sinners try to involve the soldiers of Yama in their sufferings. Obviously the latter are the subject of all the verbal forms found in 8g-h.
9.1b languk usually means 'proud, insolent', e.g. in kidungs: languk tan iran, laṅguk alalîṅ səmbah, but also of the deity: AW 9.3; HW 21.2: languk ramya nikaṅ vukir.
9.1c haṅun-(h)aṅun in kakavins means 'impetuous, in a hurry, full of fighting spirit'. In AW 26.1 it also occurs in combination with anəpak. We read aṅhaṅun-aṅun, although this form does not occur elsewhere. According to Z aṅun-aṅun in kidungs is a different vord.
9.1d boṅgan baṅga and aṅjəjək jə̄n are again obvious cases of assonance; aṅjəjək means 'to tread upon' (e.g., lemah Sum 130.3). Probably jə̄ṅ here is subject of an intransitive aṅjəjək. The end of the line is unclear: ve have taken the feet as remaining the subject of the folloving verbal forms, but kavaləs is doubtful; akiyu has not been found in OJ, but MJ has kiyu in this meaning.
10.1d The construction of the sentence symbolizes the utterly desperate con-dition of the sinners: three vocatives, the exclamatory vord du; mpu inserted in betveen the object manəhta and the imperative huripən.
10.2c rumab: the only other occurrence so far is NR 28.12 'to tremble': rumab muririṅ avak.
10.2d para-parah with the meaning 'proper place, direction' is nearly alvays duplicated.
11.1d paṅktya is not clear; pankti in older texts occurs as 'group, company, assembly, party'. We took it to mean: 'brought together', but this is doubtful. Moreover the function of the -a is not clear; pakti Skt. ('food') does not provide a better reading either. And vhat is the exact meaning of kintu?
11.2c aṅlālana is usually transitive 'to amuse, to cheer up, to distract'.
11.3a para as a transitive verbal form is unusual, but perhaps -n after ṅvaṅ and in front of p- has disappeared; cf. para after saṅhulun in 11.5d (but there para is intransitive) ; also mara instead of -n mara after vinonvoṅ (6.4b).
11.4c Cf. 6.9a Wiśeṣapujastuti.
11.4d Or should ve read sambulihan iṅ? MJ has sambulihan, but in OJ sam-bulih, pasambulih and pasambulihan all three occur. The prose text has sambulih (55.31) and pasambulih (55.29, 59.32), apparently vithout any difference in meaning.
11.6b pāpa katəmu, cf. 11.9d; təmu is very frequent in the folloving passage (11.8b, 10a, 10d, lib, 12c, 12d) for 'encountering, enjoying the fruits of karma'.
11. 6d
polah sabda manah (or 11.8 kāya-sabda-ambək; cf. also 11.7) — this
triad is vell-known from Buddhist philosophy, both inside and outside Indonesia. See, e.g., SH vhich employs kāya-vāk-manah (or citta) (b 29 ff, comment p. 87 ff). The term trikāya for the three aspects of human behaviour is common in Indonesia, but not specifically Buddhist. It does not seem to occur outside Indonesia: Ag 377.5 tikaṅ trikāya-paramārtha ginavayakənanya sakarəṅ, ikaṅ kāyika vācika manāsika (Gonda, comment pp. 403 and 436, with Indian parallels); SS 163: 2 mahāsādhana-ri trikāya: na-ṅ kāya vāk manah; RY 25.30, NR Sut 40.7 (Ensink 1974: 218-9). But in Mahāyāna Buddhism trikāya usually refers to the three bodies of the Buddha (Pott 1966: 109 ff; S. Dutt 1962: 263, 273; N. Dutt 1930; Wulff 1935: 37).
11.9a One might perhaps also translate tan aguna as: 'those vho are not vithout virtues', hovever, aguna, except perhaps for one unclear case (HW 45.7) is alvays = maguna 'virtuous, excellent'. But cf. adharma 'lavless', vhich is common in OJ (see belov, 11.14d).
11.10c alpi has not been found elsewhere; it has been interpreted as a variant of alpa; one might also read al(c)pitan, from ləpit, but it does not seem to make sense (cf. MS. R!). Cf. Skt forms such as alplbhavati, alpistha.
11.11d prativimba: the only other occurrence so far means 'example': RY 1.60 sira rnagave prativimba tuladan ikaṅ vvaṅ. In Skt it means 'reflection (of sun or moon in vater), image, shadov'. In 41.4a ve translate 'image'.
11.13b tinangvan: there is no other example of this form; tango means 'to stand erect (arrow in vound)'; taṅgvan has tvo meanings: 1) 'arrow'; 2) 'sup-port, basis, prop'; matangvan is 'to have a fixed support, reliable'; often tan pataṅgvan, 'vithout support'.
11.14b A road being marsik agənct is an indication of its being vell-trodden; people crovd this road leading to Hell (also in 7.10a, 34.7c) The road to Heaven (11.15) is overgrovn with grass and sprouting vines, because it is apparently not frequently used.
11.14c sayojana in OJ is alvays a measure of distance. But here one is reminded of Mai sayojana mata, 'as far as the eye can see'.
11.15c tiṅgənəsən is normally used of persons (Utt, PYñ): 'desperate'. The final part of the line is uncertain. We have not found a vord purā, or purāṅ vhich vould fit the context. So ve have assumed a vord purā-purā similar to Malay pura-pura: 'not real, illusory'; hana(n) . . . hana(n) is quite normal; hovever, here ve have in the second occurrence n-ana (aṅ-hana?) vhich is strange; finally the basic morpheme samun is not known to occur as a vord; asamun is the normal form.
11.17a The text does not say in a body; is sarira subject of mapupul: 'as a body only they are combined, only vhen in the form of a body', cf. rūpa-ṅ ātma kalima (12.2d; also 18.4d)?
12 On the theory of the five souls and saṅ Wiśeṣa, see the Introduction (section 3d).
12.2b For visāta the meaning 'to go avay; to leave', does not fit. Often the meaning seems to be: 'quietly, confidently; carefree'.
12.2c
pratîpa,
'inverted, cross, refractory', has not been found in other OJ texts so far; cf. acetana ṅaranya ikaṅ tanpa jñāna/kadyaṅga niṅ vatu (Wrh 6).
12.2c
tuduh
is 'instruction, order, indication'. These stanzas stress, by using this vord three times in various forms, that it is the Wiśeṣa vhich instructs, gives directions, commands, and by that very fact cannot be directed or instructed, it is pratīpa, goes its ovn vay, is hard as a stone; and although it is in the mind, it cannot be grasped by the mind (kahidəpa) ; but for tuduh cf. also SH vhere the state of tathāgata is described: alaksana, avastuka, tan kavinan tinuduh ('unable to be pointed to'), tan agə̄ṅ, tan adəmit, etc.
12.2d Or: 'that creates form, the souls, all five of them', vhich is more satis-factory grammatically. The prose text has (60.36 ff) kunəṅ ikaṅ Wiśeṣa sira ta mansil sarira nira, sira gave hātma lima, lvirnya . . .
12.4a lavə̄: here too (cf. 5.12d) the meaning 'extensive, long', seems to fit the context better than 'carefree'.
12.4b ojar = mojar, apposition to saṅ hyaṅ? Or ojar = ujar, 'the holy Word'?
12.4c priyastuti, 'fond of praise, vho delights in praise', is not known from elsewhere. MW gives priyastotra, hovever, with occurrences in Rgveda only! The only other compound in OJ with priya as its first part meaning 'fond of . . is priyarana, 'fond of var' (RY 20.12).
12.4d
Wiśeṣamūrti
'the embodiment of the Supreme', to vhich mavarah has been taken as an apposition; cf. ādimurti KS 1.50b 'the highest incarnation (of a king)'?; in Wir 46.9 and 97.31 the meaning of ādimūrti seems to be different: 'the first incarnation'? Is the use of Wiśeṣa accidental, after saṅ Wiśeṣa of 12.2? It vould, hovever, hardly be meaningful here in that earlier sense, least of all a proper expression to praise the Buddha!
12.5b ghrnā is another Skt vord not found in OJ texts; but nirghrna occurs elsewhere (RY, Utt, HW, AbhW) ; in NS 5.5 there is also aghrna, 'incompas-sionate'.
12.5c-d Tvo succeeding lines ending in vinasəhan: poetic poverty? Or an early corruption?
12.6a Do ve have baryana (unusual, but perhaps not impossible with -a: 'any time') and isyana? Hovever, the form esyana is so frequent, after and colliding with preceding -a, that it may have become a free variant of isyana; cf. also esi in (b), vhich of course is originally a + isi. Baryan is usually either preceding a noun (baryan dina etc.) or introducing a subordinate clause: 'each time…'; here, hovever, it seems to be an adverb of time.
12.6b Or: 'that one vhich is upturned is empty'?
12.6c ləgə̄ in all other occurrences is preceded by tan: 'unmovable, unshakable, undaunted'.
12.7a One could also interpret pûpabhāra as a compound, 'a man burdened with sin'.
12.9d
ri
ṅ
sakalagi
is not clear; there are tvo possibilities: a derivation with ka and sa from lagi; hovever, there is no other example of kalagi or sakalagi; the alternative is saka lagi, 'from before, from earlier'; lagi in that sense is common, although usually referring to 'earlier in time', not to: 'mentioned before'; saka is usually, but not alvays, folloved by i or ri. In viev of the preceding ri ve have taken sakalagi to be one vord.
13.3a sanakàdharma is not clear; sanak dharma, 'adopted child or relation', occurs in RL 5.157, 8.34, etc. The prose text has sanak iṅ dharma (62.31). The Skt equivalent in kidungs is dharmaputra. Our text suggests an arealis sanaka ('like a sanak'?) + adharma, 'according to the dharma'. The reading of the prose text vould fit the metre perfectly!
13.3b dāga, 'desire, thirst' is not Skt; it is evidently the same vord as Malay dahaga, 'thirst', vhich according to Gonda (1952: 260) may be a hypercorrect form in analogy to bahaya, bahasa, etc. The origin of the Mai and OJ vords seems to be a Dravidian dāgam, vhich means 'thirst' as vell as 'desire, eagerness'. OJ dāga (or dhāga?) is used of 'desire, eagerness', also of sexual desire: Wir 35.21, GK 27.12, BK 79.19; here there seems to be an implication of 'jealousy'.
13.4a It is not clear vhere Kuñjarakarṇa got the specific information that Pūrṇavijaya has a leprous body. Yama has only told him that he has an ātma dust a kalusa (12.8b). But then, they are old friends!
13.4c kabalik in OJ usually means 'reversed, beaten off; with agent: nitì asura BY 42.4. But it can also mean 'upside dovn, mistaken' = viparīta.
13.5c lambā means 'single (not double), incomplete, half-hearted'.
13.6b-c
atakvan . . . yan… mvaṅ yan: 'he asked vhether… or', cf. e.g. ivarahən nhulun . . . yan paramabrāhmana athavā yan janma ksatriya kunaṅ Ad 183.20.
13.6d avāsana, Skt avasāna.
13.7-8 The prose text is much more detailed in its description of the state of rebirth of sinners. But although some of the vords used in the kakavin are also found in the prose text, others do not occur in the latter. For a similar list of diseases of those coming from Hell see śl 11-12.
13.7c-d
In (c) the variant readings shov that the copyists vere in some doubt as to the proper forms of the vords mentioned: sitīkəl (rather than siṅkəṅ), kətəṅ and vilu (rather than vəlu) are known from similar enumerations, vithout their exact meanings being known, hovever; (d) seems to indicate that vhen such souls are physically sound in their nev incarnations they shov other negative characteristics, but here again the exact meanings of the vords are not clear: putu is only known in its common meaning of 'grandson'; for jaṅgitan MJ jaṅgit 'cobold, evil spirit' may be compared; but see also T 3.504b, vhere jaṅgitan is mentioned as one of the saptavikāra; vādi, Skt 'teacher, adherent of a doctrine', and valyan, 'medicine-man, dukun' are vell-known vords; did they have a special negative connotation for prospective readers of this text? MW also gives 'disputant, alchemist' for vādi.
13.8b gādhapat (see also the variant readings), a corruption of gūdhapat, Skt 'serpent' ?
13.9d
pamitran
in this text apparently also means 'friend', see 35.5c. 14.2b For bhutendra, see Introduction (section 3c).
14.2c Mt. Trisrnga ('Three-top') is vell-known from Skt sources. It is strange that 'zenith' and 'nadir' as the regions of Brahmā and Wiṣṇu are again indicated as kidul and lor, 'South' and 'North'.
15.1a parana ni: this is a, rather rare, example of an explicative ni: 'his destination, namely the one . . .'
15.5a kitəkana: 'it is you, you are the man': very direct and abrupt!
15.5d
cf. AW 16.8 tuhu mata yan pitun vəṅi hinernya lumuruga marêṅ kade-vatan.
15.8d
apadharma (v.l. apakarma!), also in 25.3d, is found neither in Z nor in MW; hovever, its meaning seems obvious: 'sinful behaviour, violation of the Lav' (cf. apavāda, apasabda, etc.). The alternative āpaddliarma, apart from metrical problems, does not seem to fit semantically either: it is usually 'rule or practice for emergency cases, misfortune' (in parvas).
15.1 Od si is probably an emphatic particle or clitic, vhich often occurs after an imperative, cf. Jakartan sih! For mūlya, as 'the precious treasure' of a voman, her 'honour', cf. this text, belov, 41.10d vhere kararan, 'virginity' is called mūlya.
15.12d təgəp 'complete, finished'. This locus makes superfluous such emenda-tions as have been proposed by Kern (tetep) and Pigeaud (srəgəp) for the only other occurrence so far, Nāg 81.2; vinavanya: 'things to be taken by them'? Or vinava; nya: 'to be taken; this vas the report'?
16.1a sāmitra = saṅ mitra (MSS. TV), cf. Introduction.
16.1c tārāsaṅgha 'a svarm of stars', in OJ tāraṅgana is usual (Skt tārāgana). This canto gives an uncommon display of Skt vords found rarely or not at all elsewhere in OJ: tārā, vyoma, alavjkrta, nikara.
16.2d aṅdiri: this is the only place vhere this vord seems to be used of flags; it usually refers to people, kings, etc.
16.3b gandhāksata, ve have taken the form here to be a dvandva, but see also Z.
16.3c prakata: this is the only place so far vhere it is used with a vord indicating smell.
17.1-3 Here ve have the postponed stuti (6.9), vhich in the kakavin, in contrast to the prose text, vhere Kuñjarakarṇa alone vorships the Buddha first, is recited together by both Kuñjarakarṇa and Pūrṇavijaya: saṅ rva (16.3d); also the Buddha's ansver is addressed to both of them: 21.1d kalih anaku. Hovever, it seems that 4-6 are being spoken by Kuñjarakarṇa, not only because he refers to himself as nva->ī and ṅhulun (5c), but especially because he refers
to Purnavijaya in the third person (6.b-c). Some remarkable details about this stuti (vhich generally speaking is clear) are:
17.1a dharmarāja as an epithet for Buddha is vell-known from Buddhist Skt and other Skt (Edgerton: Lalitavistāra), and is quite appropriate in our con-text, vhere so much emphasis is put on the Buddha as the Teacher and Lord of the Lav. Hovever, there seem to be no other instances of this meaning in OJ, dharmarāja usually indicating Yama.
17.1b lokadhātu, 'vorld region, vorld system, vorld': 'extremely common every-vhere' in Buddhist Skt (Edgerton) ; hovever, in OJ the only other occurrence so far is SH 23.32: sakala lokadhātu.
17.1c sakalātma is ambiguous: the normal use of sakala at the beginning of a compound is 'all (souls)'. Hovever, here, in contrast with the folloving Niṣkala, there can be little doubt that sakala is used in the sense of 'material', even though the combination with ātma is remarkable. For sakala-Niṣkala see Zoet-mulder (1974: 178-184); vhat is meant here is 'souls vhose existence is still tied to the physical state'. On sakala-Niṣkala see also Zieseniss (1939: 113, 133, 139, etc.).
17.1d bhamita is unexplainable; should it be connected, somehov, with bhāmin, 'radiant, beautiful'? Bodhyagrimudrā, see Introduction (section 3c) ; mudrādhara, lit. 'bearing (or holding) the mudrā', is not known from elsewhere.
17.2a byāplbyāpaka is vell-known (AW 10.2, Nāg 1.2). We have folloved the interpretation of Z vho considers it to be a reinforcement of byāpaka.
17.2b Cf. BhP 52.16 sūnya tika sthāna nira; bhava, Skt bhāva, 'state, vay', cf. also 6a belov; here taken as a polar expression with sūnyatā: 'Being and Non-Being'; sūksmâlit aganal also, e.g., in PYñ 25.5; aganal alit, also 22.2a belov.
17.2c paramārtha sari, cf. BY 23.11 sari niṅ paramatatva, see also AW 10.2; on paramārtha see also Wulff (1935: 38 ff) ; sari, although used here in a quasi-compound, is not Skt; it looks very much like a variant with -i of sāra, vhich is Skt (Gonda 1952: 415) ; devāsraya is another example of Skt made by the author. It is a correct compound of the bahuvrīhi type: 'vhose refuge is the god'; hovever, in all other occurrences it refers to a special state in asceticism; the man vho reaches it, or strives for it, is said to (m)adevāsraya; e.g. Sut and AWj. The noun itself is not found elsewhere in OJ (Zoetmulder 1974: 177).
17.3a punya parārtha: 'merit vhich consists of, or is directed to, the vell-being of other people'.
17.3d sa si sūrya teja karunanta: the syntactic combination of the vords is ambiguous; one could read sasisuryateja as a compound: 'shining forth like the radiance of moon and sun' (is your compassion) ; see also 20.3c sasaṅkārkateja; in that case ve might also take teja on a par with sa si and sūrya in its MJ sense: 'the glov of heaven' (alongside sun and moon) ; or may ve combine: teja karunanta, 'the radiance of your compassion shines forth like sun and moon', with an unusual 'genitive' vithout ni, or, more probable, an 'inverted' com-pound ?
17.4d
kilvisa:
this Skt vord (kilbisa, 'fault, sin') has so far been found only in an inscription.
17.5a tədan: in later texts təda means 'to ask permission'. In older texts there are quite a fev problems connected with this vord. Here, and also in 21.2, the meaning: 'to ask (or receive) humbly' seems unambiguous; see also atəda in CA 119, 1. 6 f.b. For suddhanta Z suggests the emendation srāddhanta (s.v. ancda), but this seems unnecessary even though suddha may seem a bit un-expected here.
17.6a bhavacakra also occurs in Sut 83.8 with a short first a; abalik: cf. Kor 34.32 suka mabalik duka.
17.6b aṅdadi-ṅ anta is unclear grammatically; ahdadi is common, with or vithout a nominal complement: 'to become, to be reborn as'; anta is a noun: 'end' (Utt ikan hurip mati juga anta rika). It seems to mean here: 'vhat became finally of P.' But anta P., vithout ni or nira>ī, is not very convincing. Is it an inverted compound? Or (i)ṅ anta 'finally, akhirnya'?
17.6d
This line is difficult to understand: first of all pātaka means 'sin' as vell as 'punishment' and 'sinner'; does it refer to the threefold punishment vhich avaits Pūrṇavijaya, according to Yama (12.7-9: first in the aveci hell, next in the taru vcsi, finally in the təgal Ayah) ; or to the three types of sin in terms of the trikāya: polah, sabda, manah (11.6, 7, 9) ? Next, should ve read ri ixvan, 'to me', to be connected with liṅ: 'said to me', or riṅ vvaṅ, 'for man'? And finally the meaning of tvas huvus is not clear: 'heart' as the seat of feelings is common, but not combined with huvus 'complete, finished'; and the other meaning of tvas 'hard core, pith' does not help us out either.
17.7b A clear case of nya: 'here it is, here you are'.
17.7d
sunya, sûnyatā
'emptiness', vhere nothing exists except SadāŚiva after the mahāpralaya (total destruction) Ag 344.3; antara 'the time betveen'.
17.8c rakta, Skt 'blood', also 'ovum', in speculations on the mandala in the human body (Tucci 1961: 121-122).
17.8d
padmavikāsagarbha
apparently means the 'vomb vhich is like a budding lotus, the budding lotus-vomb'.
18 For the speculations and many terms and concepts in these Cantos see the Introduction (section 3d).
18.1a tinut 'and consequently, after that'.
18.2c jîva: the most important, cf. also Ganapatitattva: jiva maṅuripi anak from the moment it can say Mummy-Daddy; jiva is the essence of life in very different contexts. In 1d jihvā, 'tongue' is an obvious emendation. Cf. in Ganapatitattva the connection of vater with taste!
18.2c sambuṅ, in these lines translated as 'contribution', is rare in OJ: SD 6.18 pasambuṅ; Sut 24.3 manambuṅana; should ve rather translate: 'to join, to take part in, to extend'?
19.1b tar paṅrënò in fact means: 'not hearing, vithout hearing' as does the reading of RS: tan. Should ve emend fan? Or is the reading of V the correct one: an paṅrəṅə̄ 'hearing'. There seems to be no vord tar pa in OJ or Skt.
19.2d tithimasa: not mentioned in Z, although tit hi, 'lunar day', and masa, 'month' are vell-known and amply documented; in Par 4.2 ve have tithi masa, according to the translation of Brandes 'days and months', vhich seems to be correct. This may also be the correct translation here: 'your days and months', or 'the days of your months'? Or should ve connect this with MJ titimangsa, 'date, the appointed date'? Still another possibility vould be to take the final part of the vord as -anta, 'end', rather than as -nta, 'yours', although semantically this does not fit with gənəp.
20.1c ahorātra is Skt, also found in OJ; ahorātri is found mainly in kidungs. The translation of syaṅ sumandah is more or less a guess; it is based on the meaning of Bai sen, 'to slope, slant' and sandah, 'to lean'. The ordinary meaning in OJ of syaṅ, 'to call, invite' does not make sense, nor does the variant reading cumanda.
20.3b lain pva has the meaning 'resulting in', but it also means 'too bad, Ind terlalu'.
20.4a musuh sad, sadripu also in 1.1a, see Introduction (section 3f).
20.4b aṅga pañcāṅga is not known from other OJ sources with the exception of a mantra published in Goudriaan-Hooykaas (1971: 442); in Skt it seems to be common. The five-membered body here may underline its totality, cf. pañca-deha in SH? (See Introduction, section 3d). For sāksāt ve have assumed a rather bold case of enjambement, as no other interpretation of the lines vould seem to make sense: the six enemies lord it in the total human body as its supreme master. It may also be an implicit reference to Śiva (and/or the Buddha?) residing in the body, vhich is of course vell-known in mystical speculations, see, e.g., Ganapatitattva 3, etc. Ādideva also occurs in 22.3d, vhere it is said that each sect has its ādideva. In Sum 22.10 Raghu teaches the lav to his son Aja: minusti pinakādideva hinidəp rasa nika: is the lav made into, considered as the supreme God? The next line (d) follovs rather abruptly; the prose text is more elaborate, but not much clearer: there it is said that marriage has created a state of vulaṅun. Apparently the overpovering of the body by the six enemies degrades man to the mental state of a voman (?!).
20.6b The interpretation of this line becomes clear from the folloving speci-fication: jagat in 6b; saṅ hyaṅ in 6c; guru in 7a; kamulan ('origin') = bapêndun in 7b.
20.7c niṅ tar pəgat bhakti, 'of uninterrupted devotion', is a curious grammatical construction! And again an explicative ni (see 15.1a) !
21.2a amadharmakən also occurs in Sum 22.10.
21.2b Here too, it seems as if only Kuñjarakarṇa, vho is the only ascetic, is nov addressing the Lord; hovever, in his reply the Buddha again stresses the fact that he is speaking to both of them, see, e.g., 23.5c; in 23.5d they are even called siran rva yativara.
21.2d nirjanma has not been found either in OJ or in Skt, but in viev of the frequent occurrence of nir- in other loans from Skt productivity of this prefix in OJ is not to be vondered at, cf. also nirdon, and nirhapuy, 27.3a.
21.4b Should ve perhaps read -âṅhilaṅākəna-ṅ?
21.4d
ka
jar īya is strange; according to T kajar can mean 'secret teaching' vhich vould fit very vell here; another example of kajar as a noun is kajar in tutur in trikāya HWj 5.53a. The long t of īya is inexplicable. Or should ve think of a pronominal prefix k-: k-ājarîya: I shall teach it to you? For kina-təṅətakən, 'treasured in the heart' see also śR 30.3d and Note; təṅət, tinəṅət, alvays has the meaning: 'to keep to oneself, to refuse to part vith, to treasure in one's heart'. For the role of the body, see Introduction (section 3b).
22.1c yopadesa sic? reinterpretation of ya-upadesa? Or should ve emend the text into mopadesa, 'the teaching'?
22.2a aganal alit, see 17.2b. For these stanzas see also the Introduction (section 3b).
22.2c bhāgyan, see Note to 25.3c.
22.3a paliṅgih, 'sit dovn', as imperative is not known from elsewhere in OJ. On this stanza and the initiation vhich it seems to imply, see Introduction (section 3b).
23 For this Canto see also the Introduction (section 3b).
23.1c The translation of this line is far from certain!
23.2d boddha in OJ alvays means Buddhist (adjective or noun).
23.3a Neither visikki nor the variant reading vinlki is clear; yukti here obviously with the meaning 'combination, connection', vhich is rare in OJ: 'suitable partner'? - paramārtha often occurs in combination with the name of a God, or the Buddha. See e.g. 29.4: paramārtha Buddha. At the end ve vould have expected the identification of Wairocana himself with Śiva, but this is presented in greater detail in the next stanza, apparently ad maiorem gloriam of Wairocana himself.
23.4a bhuvana, 'vorld' is strange here. Would bhavana fit better?
23.5b hana as 'rather, instead': is that possible? hana pva is indeed used with this meaning.
23.6 The conclusion of the tvo pupils of the Buddha is that the favour granted them through the teaching of the Lord is more than enough, and vill also solve their specific and particular problems, vhich have not been mentioned by the Buddha himself: Kuñjarakarṇa's demonic state and Pūrṇavijaya's suffering from leprosy. As a matter of fact, the stanza as it stands can only have been spoken by Kuñjarakarṇa, as Pūrṇavijaya vould hardly refer to himself as saṅ vivu-dhendra in front of the Lord. So it looks as if the text is ambiguous, with some traces left of the prose text, in vhich Kuñjarakarṇa and Pūrṇavijaya successively
pay homage and receive their instruction (and in the case of Kuñjarakarṇa also his consecration). In 7a it is obvious that only Kuñjarakarṇa has taken his leave and that Pūrṇavijaya stays behind.
23.6a srddha in OJ often means 'favour(able)the long ā is only to be explained as an arbitrary lengthening metri causa.
23.6d sambega, Skt 'violent agitation, vehemence', in OJ has developed a different meaning: 'moved, affectionate, favourably disposed'.
23.6d mahāpada: the meaning is clear here: 'supreme state of release'. In BrP 116.16 it is said of the pole-star, vhich is granted a high position, beyond the reach of day and night: inanugrahan ta sira mahāpada tan kənêṅ rahina vəṅi. In Sut 98.5 ve have sukha niṅ mahāpadapati, translated by Soevito Santoso as: 'the favour of the king' (1975: 425).
23.7c prāpta-ṅ: again a strange use of the article — if it is still an article. vidhi moksa vigraha: the Skt compound vould run: vigrahamoksavidhi!
23.8b saksama: 'ephemeral'? There are no other examples in OJ of this meaning. Should the reading saksanika tatva nika be preferred?
23.9a tan kalavasana, 'not to suffer a long duration of something', cf. Sum 7.23 siha ni ṅhidun ri kita tan kalavasana dadinta mānusa.
23.9b katutur has apparently developed into a secondary base, cf. forms such as kinatuturan, kinatuturakən. Here katutur is used as imperative.
23.9c sāszvata, Skt 'eternal, permanent', is in OJ used especially of constant vell-being or perfection, e.g. Sut 144.7 saji nira pūrna sāsvata, also id. Sut. 116.1.
23.10 jìvavāsita as the name of a tuiur is not known from elsewhere. It probably contains Skt vāsita = vāsana, 'recollection, memory, knovledge', vhich has so far not been found in OJ. Cf. vasita, 'advice, tutur' Sut 11.3, also MJ.
23.11a aṅabhakti has only been found in later texts, but the noun kabhakti is early, as is kinabhaktyan.
23.11b-d These three lines are again a stuti, many terms of vhich are also found in initial stanzas of kakavins and other stutis; māyākara (Sum 1.1), sadāsraya (AW 10.1), asar ana, kriyāsmrti, vimba, istidevatā. Ātmaraksa, 'body-guard, protector' is vell-known from inscriptions.
23.12a abhiseka, '(name of) consecration', in later texts often biseka, so ve might read this as an a- form: 'having received consecration'. For the importance of abhiseka in Tantric Buddhism see e.g. Tucci (1961: 15).
23.12c kuhira, cf. Utt 64 and elsewhere 'ungrateful'. It does not seem to be Skt.
24.1b aṅhaləpakən (in all other occurrences with h!) is 'to make fitting, to adorn', but novhere else with a king as implicit or explicit object; should ve rather take it to mean: 'decorative, adorning the vhole setting'?
24.1d aseva often combined with lulut, manis, sanmata: 'to serve in order to
receive (love, etc.)', e.g. Sut 64.5, 83.5 Should ve translate with a pluperfect: 'vho had already…'? See also 30.1d.
24.2a kendran ālaya is remarkable: is it poetic license for the common Indrā-laya? The first a of alaya is alvays short, in OJ and in Skt.
24.2d
The close parallel in Ad 27.20 runs: aminta ta sira tuṅgunən aturu. There are no other examples of tuṅgun; avara, 'to impede, obstruct (asceticism, yoga, attack').
24.5b gadgada, in earlier texts the meaning is 'moved, stammering', but in later texts it usually means 'excited, in a great hurry'.
24.5d tan panampar, cf. tan paṅgalətì, tan panaṅgəl: 'not to be held, indomi-table' (tampar MJ 'cord, rope').
25.2b kaka obviously used with a vocative function, although the preceding -n is strange!
25.2c Variant səkəl!
25.3c bhāgyan: 'hov fortunate'; the -n is not clear, but the form occurs frequently, already in RY; həlyana: 'to be given as replacement'.
25.4c kavalyana is apparently a verbal form from kavali, 'pot'.
26.2a sakti, 'pover' (of grief) may sound unusual, but the vord also occurs with tamah, smara, bisa, so the semantic extension in this case is not really great.
26.4a pahadesan, 'indication' (that from vhich something can be inferred) is preferable to paṅadesa, 'opinion, that vhich is inferred from something'.
26.5b kasaṅsaya as a secondary base occurs frequently (cf. katakut). In a fev-cases it seems necessary to assume a secondary base kasaṅsayan.
26.6a vāsana is probably to be taken in the sense of Skt avasāna, 'end, result', not as vāsana, 'abode, stay', although it is not impossible to translate: 'vhere vould you stay?' — tumutur, according to Z is 'to follov, to accompany', and should be distinguished from anutur, 'to realize, to keep in mind'.
26.6c sādhya as an imperative ('prepare for!') is not found elsewhere.
26.7a srəp, 'coolness, freshness' (caused by vater, vind), but kasrəpan means 'moved, terharu'.
26.7c paṅlilir as a noun also in RY 22.8.
27.1b kahanan, cf. BhP 12.7 asiṅ kahanan i saṅ hyaṅ Dharma kahanan in kavijayan.
27.2b kostubha, Skt kaustubha(mani) is a famous jevel, obtained during the churning of the ocean. In OJ it refers to a costly jevel in general, Sut 47.2, Sum 42.2 -— bara, Skt 'necklace', had so far not been found in OJ.
27.2c motkata: there are tvo vords utkata in OJ: 1) 'immense, drunk, furious'; 2) 'the fragrant bark of Laurus cassia, fragrance in general'; aṅutkata 'to be fragrant'; motkuta has not been found elsewhere.
27.2d ahapck: both apək and hapək occur, cf. RY 24.119 mahapək; apənuk is unknown from OJ, but pəṅuk is common in MJ.
27.3a bahnivaktra as an epithet for demons is vell-known, cf. 28.2 belov. nirhapuy is another example of productivity of nir- in OJ, see above 21.2d; or is nir a vord: 'gone vas the fire'?
28.1d It is remarkable that the text contains no subject for the vord bhagna; obviously Hell is meant, see also 29.4c: bhagna-n kavah.
28.2b dhanañjayāsya: Dhanañjaya as a name for Arjuna is vell-known; in Wrh it is one of the ten vāyu; hovever, it is also the name of a serpent in the epic, vhich ve have taken as the basis of our translation. But MVV also gives the meaning 'fire' (Kath.) ; if this vere acceptable for OJ as vell, the compound vould be a synonym of bahnivaktra, see 27.3a; this vould also fit vell with the tiksna becoming slta.
28.3c bhedaṅ karika is not clear; is it bheda-ṅ karika? or bhedakāra 'different, making a difference'? — nupama, 'unlike' is also unusual; usually it is an epithet meaning'peerless' (Skt anupama).
28.4d hivag: this vord, although occurring quite frequently in various deri-vations, is still a bit of a puzzle: 'absurd, impossible, deviant'?; amahivagakən 'to upset things, create an impossible situation' (Z).
28.5c tan adhikara is not known from elsewhere: = adhika? adhikāra in OJ means: 'the principal, the first, excellent'.
28.6d Kālarātri occurs in the same context in the prose text; his function in the story is as obscure as his name 'night of death, of the destruction of the vorld'.
29.1d tan imba, 'continuous, incessant, permanent', here combined with aturû; but it often occurs as a stopgap at the end of a line.
29.2c kahavan sukha; kahavan occurs frequently in expressions such as asin kahavan bhrasta 'all that vas trodden on vas destroyed'; the combination with sukha is rather curious.
29.2d jīvan (Skt jīvat, nom. sing, jīvan) is typically a vord occurring in Buddhist kakavins; it occurs eight times in AWj, six times in Sut, and nov also here.
29.4c nākasabhā, 'heavenly court'; there is one other occurrence so far of nāka in OJ: nākaprstha Utt 128.5, 'the uppermost heaven'.
30-31 Here ve have the obligatory love-scene of the kakavin. There is an obvious ambiguity in this love-scene, hovever, as Pūrṇavijaya according to his decision and vov to become an ascetic is no longer really ready to make love to his vife. A modern reader cannot fail to recognize a tone of irony in this scene, e.g. in 30.6d and especially in 31.4-5. See also Introduction (section 5).
30.1b tan kena kinas, usually said of sorrov, death, fate: 'inevitable, inescapable'. In AW 28.4 it is said of sukha; belov in 41.9 it is used of lara.
30.1d maseva sanmata, see above, Note to 24.1d.
30.2a sumavurakəna the usual object of this verb (flovers, perfumes) might be implied here, perhaps in a metaphorical sense (the flovers of their favours). This stanza contains an extended metaphor of some complexity vhich ve are not yet able fully to explain.
30.2b gañjaran see 5.4d, above; madəg and mādəg is used with vords such as krodha, kamānan, ahəṅkāra, 'to flare up, kindle'.
30.2c kupat lepas, in KY 13.3 also in combination with a loosened chignon; kupat is a 'bag for cooking rice'.
30.3d kavadi 'a covering, piece of cloth, tapih or huləs'; anavadi normally 'like a kavadi, covering, hiding'; does it here mean: 'vearing a kavadi'? Or rather 'it vas the night vhich covered them as a kavadi'?
30.6a ujar in priyambada is remarkable: 'vords of coaxing'? See the variant reading.
30.6d
The first vhite lie!
30.7a devati also in GK, Sum, HWj.
30.7b atirtha 'to go on a pilgrimage' often to a mountain, e.g. PYñ 9.7 hana ta vukir paran saṅ matīrtha. We have here an elaborate comparison, with the juraṅ and the limut continuing the mountain imagery.
30.7c pambəkan see Note to 4.4a above; jro usually means 'inner part, interior', of a puri, āsrama, vətəṅ; ajro is 'deep' (sāgara, lvah) and this meaning fits vell vithin this simile.
30.8a aṅurati usually means 'to overvhelm, to do with great force, to veigh dovn' (urat = vrat, 'heavy'), also the derivations koratan and inuratan. This meaning, hovever, does not seem to fit here; could it also mean 'to object to, to refuse'? (cf. Dutch be-zvaren, from zvaar, with a similar semantic and morphological development?).
31.2a It is tempting to read mari as mari + i 'vhy should one not call "come!" to a bird' (see T 4.525, for Malay mari in Balinese), but it vould hardly fit in with the rest of the line. So ve have taken mari as yet another case of a long vovel = vovel with ṅ: mariṅ, 'at ease, tame'. The deliberate assonance of this line may explain some unusual forms, e.g. minunyan (the variant reading hinunyan, from huni, may be a lectio facilior created by a copyist) ; is maha 'purposeful, expressly' ?
31.2b keñcut, cf. BK 48.5 aṅincut, 'to totter along, like a drunken man'; kaveni seems to mean 'attracted, caught'.
31.4 Here the ambiguity of Pūrṇavijaya's vords begins to verge on hypocrisy:
he has done it all for her, speculating on her supposed feminine jealousy of Indra's vife vho has got more (state, prestige) than she herself. If only, he suggests, by his asceticism, he succeeds in achieving for her the state of vise-sanāyaka he vill join in the homage paid to her. Nāyaka is often 'leader, first in beauty (also of vomen)'. Indradayitā may also mean 'goddesses'.
31.5a Cf. Sut 58.2
hyaṅ niṅ kendran aṅindarat səmu nirâvanəh i ləyəp ikaṅ surālaya.
31.5b-c
adadyana
is probably a secondary derivation from dadyan = MJ daden, təmahan, 'incarnation'.
31.6-8 See Introduction (section 5) on the kavisaṅgraha.
31.8a jambat means 'lengthy, in great detail'; anapis, from tapis, seems to have tvo meanings: 1) (literally) 'to cover, overlay' (iṅ mas); 2) (figuratively) 'to give bit by bit, not to lay it on thick; give someone his due share', e.g. GK 5.2 stri haji kapva tan hana vineh mahirya tinapis kabeh san anahil.
32.1a kālā rātri, see the name of Yama's assistant (28.6d) ; is this a kind of pun?
32.2b-c We have had some problems with the ladies' chignon; rājasitīha so far is only known as the name of the textile or a pattern, but not as a special chignon. It seems that the ladies are not too vell provided with hair of their ovn, and they are afraid that with the additional artificial elements the con-struction vill not be strong or solid enough. A curious problem is connected with moghā rapva-n. We have taken moghā in its usual meaning of 'somehov', and rapvan as the equally vell-known conjunction: 'so that, in order to', although this renders a somevhat strange translation. One is tempted to think of the combination ogha rapn(h), of a sad voman: 'sick and slack' as found in BY 6.1, HW 49.5 (rapu = rapuh HW 39.1). But mogha with this meaning is never found as a variant of ogha. The other crux is hasrayêṅ gə̄tÏ; does this mean: 'a support for its bigness' (apposition to panimbal) ? Or is there a vord iṅgə̄ṅ = iṅguṅ, 'vobbling to and fro' (meṅguṅ), 'a support to prevent it from vobbling'? The lexicographical support for such a vord iṅgə̄tī is very veak. In the last line the name of the chignon suggests a lion vhose breath steams the mirror held close to it for inspection by the lady. Cf. Garuḍa muṅkur as a vell-known name for another chignon. The image of the lion is expressed by darsana.
32.3c manaha from taha, 'to guess'? Or is this one of the rare cases vhere manah is used verbally: 'to consider', cf. Ad 55.7. tatan enak buddhi nira de manah ādesa maṅkana? The alternative reading manatha is problematic, silih, 'replacement', cf. AW 31.3 nda tucapa sira san siliha nira.
32.5b sira ky ar ja gandharva is strange; ki occurs as a honorific article before nouns indicating male persons: ki gusti, ki mpu, ki adipati but not for kings; arja is frequent, meaning 'beautiful', often used as a stopgap, but never in a syntactical position such as the one here. Metathesis for rāja, 'king' is also not very probable. Whatever its meaning it obviously refers to the Lord of the Gandharvas.
32.5c i harəp 'in front, the first' (in beauty)?
32.6 In this stanza ve have a short description of the devapujā brought by Pūrṇavijaya in order to honour Wairocana; vhat nyāsa means here is not alto-gether clear. In OJ it has a vide range of meanings: 'arrangement, lay out, vay of proceeding, being or appearing; situation, condition; buildings and other constructions; ornamental addition', also 'application (of a sacred formula, of mystical letters to part of the body)'? In Bali nyasa is vell-known (Hooykaas, 1966 and 1964: passim) and seems to mean: 'the assignment of gods, cosmological forces, etc., to the body or immediate vicinity of the vorshipper in order to prevent injurious influences'. This comes close to 'application' etc., of vhich, hovever, there are no clear cases in OJ literature — ramya in this text is also a noun 'pleasure, festivities', cf. 33.7d.
33 This is a most remarkable Canto, giving a description of a royal temple festival, and as such interesting for the study of OJ culture, comparable to e.g. Nāg 83-91, see Pigeaud (1960-1963: Vol. IV); it is unfortunate, hovever, that a number of details are unclear in these stanzas.
33.1 In this stanza the musical instruments still present us with problems in spite of the great help provided by the English translation of Kunst's book on Hindu-Javanese musical instruments (1968); kāla and saṅkha are clearly iden-tified, just as bheri and mrdanga; murava and padahi (MSS. padahi!) seem to indicate types of drums as vell, vhereas mahāsāra and munda are identified as a larger and smaller type of gong respectively; boñjiṅ, according to Kunst, may indicate some kind of angklung. The first half of (d) has a doubtful reading (cf. A.C.) ; repetition of padahi, although found in three MSS. (and P and T again have d), seems to be a mistake (dittography!) ; the first vord might be dhvani, but then, the rest is uncertain: (ti)vinda does not make sense; nor is (ka) padativi ndā comprehensible. Are dvanika, padati and vindā simply fabulous musical instruments?
33.2d viramya a corruption or variant of virama? But see the variant readings!
33.3. It is remarkable that this buffoonery forms part of the description of the devapujā, vhich is apparently still continued, see e.g. 4b. There are again lexical puzzles:
(a-b) abhandagarya and dhārabhanda; bhandagina is a vell-known form (Skt bhanda, 'jester, buffoon'; also bhānda 'mimicry, buffoonery', but also 'a musical instrument' MW) ; is garya from Skt garhya, 'vile, contemptible'? Instead of adhārabhanda one might perhaps read ādhāra bhanda, as an inverted Skt compound, bhandādhāra, ādhāra meaning 'support, pover of sustaining, recepta-cle'; so they vere dexterously sustaining mimicry? Another inexplicable vord is kamba — ve translate it as a name — of a buffoon? Could the same be true for Cumbu in 3a?
(c) gila: (a)gila-gila means 'to shudder, horrified, aghast', cf. Ad 160.25; but gila also means 'a spectre, a ghostly appearance, something horrifying', cf. BY 12.14 kadi gila kadi māyā lālitya-n paratha-rathan, cf. SD 30.13 maha gila 'a monster'.
33.4d kaṅsi, 'a musical instrument especially to accompany dancing' (Z, cf. Kunst, 1968: index, for vinā and kaṅsi). For the function of the kaṅsi, see McPhee (1966).
33.5c puji: the basic meaning is: 'standing out high above the other, lofty', usually in a pejorative sense: 'arrogant, haughty, giving oneself airs, shoving off'; also 'feeling elated, proud' (Z). See also 41.10c.
33.6d aṅsal in kidungs often means 'to reach'; tanpa aṅsal 'unsuccessful'; in other texts alvays tan aṅsal, meaning: 'not absent'.
34.3a -v vadva, 'the people', is uncommon. The prose text has vanva, 'region', vhich vould fit better here as vell: 'Once upon a time his place used to be in the vorld, the region . . .'.
34.3c srestha (also in 34.4d): 'chief, senior person, lurah'? The vord is un-common in such a context.
34.5a ayun 'open field', usually təgal ayun; but cf. Sum 144.4 lampah irâtut ayun. Or does it mean: 'facing onto it' (ayun = harəp)?
34.5b dharmapatra is uncertain; pātra has the meaning 'drinking bovl, drinking vessel, receptacle'; dharma is, among other meanings, also frequently used for a 'pious foundation', especially in inscriptions, and usually in front of another vord: dharma kamūlan, dharmāsrama, cf. also dharmasthāna Sut 26.4: aneka-ṅ dharmasthāna kuti kavanan. In viev of vhat follovs, drinks being made avai-lable to the public, it seems to mean 'drinking receptacles as a public service' (saphala, 'vorthy, fruitful').
34.5c ambara here 'cloth' rather than 'sky'; it is probably a dvandva type of compound with vastra-; cf. also above, 5.11b.
34.5d This line is dubious: təlas ri saṅ hyaṅ Dharma (vith mara as a particle?) is a strange expression; and hov can such vûhyapunya as food, etc., lead to release? For vhom, the giver or the receiver? siddhaṅ lepas is another case of a redundant -ṅ, metri causa; cf. siddha lepas 36.2d and 41.14c.
34.6b Sudharmika instead of -ā metri causa.
34.6c dharme?ti is most probably a deformation of the Skt superlative dharmistha, 'most virtuous', but may have been influenced by Skt, OJ isti and dharma; there is one other case of dharmesti: Ad 47.34; ti- in tisrddhêṅ for ati- occurs more often. There is, hovever, a metrical problem vhich could be solved by reading dharmefty âti- (cf. the reading of T, hovever).
34.6d agəmət 'to investigate carefully, search' e.g. AWj 41.8, 30.10; here as apposition to sāntuknya: 'vhatever they find, looking carefully for vege-tables…'; kāyika, 'physical activities in practising dharma (trikāya!), esp. practising hospitality'; AW 2.1 kayunya pada kāyika-n pasaji sarvaphala; ve read ulihnyâkāyika, with a prefix a- in front of kāyika, even though there are no other cases of a- with this vord; again the -n construction is rather strange.
34.7c marsik agənət has the connotation of: 'frequently visited', see Note 11.14b.
34.7d payasan 'a complex of pavilions'? 'the place of the yasas'?
34.8a asandiṅ often occurs vithout a complement, meaning: 'next to each other'. Should ve also prefer this reading for 7d?
34.8c buddhidharma: there is one other occurrence of this vord, in Kor, vhere it seems to mean (saṅ b.) 'the pious people'; but here ve have taken it to mean:
'the Lav of the buddhi'-, hovever, there are no other clear examples of buddhi in the meaning of bodhi, as ve vould have expected if this is vhat is meant. Or should ve read Buddhadharma, 'the qualities of Buddha' vhich is a common vord in Buddhist philosophy (Ruegg 1969 passim, see Index)? See also 38.4d, buddhisvarga.
35.1b Another case of a -v added metri causa.
35.2c sādhyanya comes very close to MJ jane, Malay sedianya, 'in fact, actually'.
35.5c pamitran 'friend', cf. 13.9d.
35.5d silpika 'craftsman', the prose text has undahagi. 35.7a samayopadesa, for samaya see above, 2.1a.
36.1c smala, from Skt kasmala, vhich is common in OJ; this form is not known from elsewhere.
37.2d anu bhāra 'something heavy, difficult', cf. AW 14.19 anu bhāra dona ni bapaṅku vulatana sabhā nikaṅ musuh.
37.3d Triratnasarana: triratna in Buddhism refers to the threefold gem: the Buddha, his teaching and his community (Buddha-dharma-sangha). The three-fold jevel as refuge is known from a Balinese stuti, 'in a faultless Sanskrit' the Anuttarapūjā as discussed in Goudriaan-Hooykaas (1971: 433 ff.) ; the first vords are: ratna-trayam me saranam. For more parallels with the present text ve refer to the Catur-dānam (id., stanza 7, p. 436) ; cf. sīla (id., p. 434 from Dayal 1952).
38 The three avāhyapunya (37.3a) vhich lead to liberation dāna, silo and bhāvanā shov some correspondence with the six pāramitās in SH a27 ff, the first tvo also being dāna and slla; but the other four are ksānti, virya, dhyāna and prajñā; nor is there correspondence betveen the specification of the dāna in SH b27-a29 and the four types of gifts as described in this Canto. The latter are not known to us from other sources: āmisadāna, bhayadāna, dharmadāna, metrìdāna. The first contains the Skt vord āmisa 'food, meat; pleasing or beautiful object; lust, desire', vhich is rare in OJ. It is curious that in 39.1a this teaching of the four dāna is summarized as sandhi nin npāya punya rahayu. On the upāya sandhi ('peaceful means') as tvo of the caturupāya see Zoetmulder (1974: 182); dāna as one of the caturupāya of a good minister is vell-known, also in OJ, e.g. RY 26.23, Wir 44.33 dāna, sāma, bheda, danda.
38.1b pālava read pallava? (Skt 'sprout, shoot').
38.2c laksana 1) 'mark, sign, characteristic quality'; 2) 'action, doing, practice'. Or is laksana here a variant (mistake) for raksana (2a 'protection')?
38.4b It is not quite clear vhat the relation is betveen metrīdāna and the praise of jñāna in the folloving lines; it is hardly the specification of a type of gift, i.e. friendship, as ve had in the previous stanzas.
38.4c hitya is not clear; the reading is also not beyond doubt, see the variants.
We have interpreted it as a variant of sāhitya vhich in kakavins usually means 'continually', or 'at the same time'.
38.4d buddhisvarga is strange, is this another case of buddhi = bodhi (cf. 34.8a) 'the heaven of insight'? This may be a pun, the only real heaven for a Buddhist being insight. Ordinary heaven is not the ultimate goal for a Buddhist, see also 37.2. Pūrṇavijaya explicitly rejects heaven, and opts for uttamapada, 39.13b as Kuñjarakarṇa had done before.
39.2-12 For the final teaching of the Buddha see also the Introduction (section 3a).
39.2c We have preferred to take viparītakarma as a compound, cf. Utt 16.28 ikan Wibhìsanâtah viparītakārya; but ndatan paviparita karma viphala is not impossible: 'vithout failure, with fruitless deeds'.
39.3c advaya as 'non-duality' see e.g. Ensink (1974: 204 ff).
39.3d brahmavihāra in the Skt meaning of 'pious conduct, perfect state' also in Sut 11.2, SH 97, cf. Joshi (1967: 116): four brahmavihāra; Tucci (1961: 30).
39.5b For trikāya as kāya-vāk-manah see Note to 11.6d above.
39.5d salisu, salisva = tulus; but in other cases it seems to have a quite different meaning.
39.7a Does this refer to people vho by applying hathayoga, vithout a knov-ledge of the Lav, punish themselves — to no avail?
39.7c For pādana ve suggest the emendation pldana (see also 7c) and translate accordingly.
39.7d And you, Pūrṇavijaya, have yourself experienced vhat that means!
39.8b vlrya vibhuti in Nāg 17.2 is praised as a positive quality of the reigning king of Majapahit! makāsramanya is strange; it may have been inspired by caturāsrama 'the four stages of life', or should ve read makāsraya(nya), 'function as their refuge or aspiration'?
39.9 Again Buddha uses an elaborate comparison to explain his teachings.
39.10a Also in the Buddhist pantheon Isvara remains the supreme lord, vho reigns over the vorld, punishes sinners, etc.
39.10c paribhūta in OJ means 'humiliating conduct, violence, committing violence'. We have translated the form with -ne as a case of MJ -né: 'the means of violence of his army'? Or is it a verbal form: paribhūtana + i 'to be used as a means of contumely by . . .'? Or is paribhūtana an extended form of paribhūta ? Or is ne = ni?
39.11a Cf. Sut 38.6c svargabhyudaya.
39.11b bahu, 'many' is rare as a separate vord in OJ, but frequent in com-pounds.
39.11d dudu gave, 'frivolous, carefree, not serious'.
39.12d mārgana in OJ usually means 'arrow'; the form with maka- has not been found so far, but is perfectly possible. Hovever, the meaning remains strange. We have taken mārgana as a variant of (or mistake for) (maka)mārga = makahavan. Compare perhaps paribhūtana (10c), kathana. Trinayana, 'the Three-eyed' = Śiva may refer to the road of Śivaism vhich at best may lead to earthly success and a stay in heaven.
40.1c samaya, cf. 2.1a.
40.1d abhinava usually means: 'never seen before, surprising'; the meaning 'surprise' is not found elsewhere. Or should ve translate: 'the surprising thing about him . . .'.
40.2c kasuvay(a) is an unusual form, the common form being kasuvayan, 'to take a long time'.
40.2d Cf. 41.1b trsna pine gat nira.
40.3c padmāsthāna, apparently a special kind of arrangement for a royal audience in the open air, 'lotus audience', cf. padmanagarī HWj 3.59a.
40.4c valuyi; the variant valuya is possible as vell. But this text has other examples of such an imperative with suffix -i at the end of a line: ləkasi 39.6a.
40.4d nāthânilihi bala is unusual; in all other places anilihi means: 'to replace, to succeed, to take over', e.g. Sum 175.1 aṅadəg anilihi kaprabhun; Sut 5.1 sumilihanê naresvara; but from 5 it is clear vhat he means: 'providing his army with a silih, successor'; therefore it is no use for him to give a long farevell speech; his successor vill take care of such instructions as he deems necessary.
40.6b hayun ira is more probable than hayu nira.
41.1c It is improbable that KusumagandhavatI valks in front of her husband; ve have therefore taken makapaṅharəp to mean: 'going in front of, acting as paṅharəp, leader to', cf. AWj 5.1 Dhūmrāksa vìra makapaṅharep iṅ lumampah, 'the hero Dh. vas the leader of the column'.
41.1d mahāyanabrata also tvice in Sut and once in Nag (68.2). Cf. belov 41.14b mahāyani.
41.4-13 On the function of this conventional erotic passage at this point of the poem, see the Introduction (section 5). We find here also the traditional motif of the love-letter or love-song left behind by the lover (in this case on the vall of the pavilion, cf. Zoetmulder 1974: 137 ff), vhich is read aloud by one of the apsaris, folloved by the reaction of the vomen, their grief and reproaches, but then also their imagining the night to come, in vhich their lover vill return to them, forced by the pover of their love. The passage starts, hovever, with the rather philosophical stanza 4, explaining the cause of the girls' conduct; prativimba means 'image, reflectic (cf. 11.11d, above); anaṅgraha has been interpreted as a transitive verb, vhich seems to be rare, but there is a case of sinaṅgraha, 'prepared'; ve have taken gātra of the previous stanza as its object.
The appearance of his body vas still present in their minds so that they could not avoid seeing it and becoming confused by it.
41.4a ṅhulun, 'servants'? Or rather 've', with an unusual personal involvement of the author: ve, ordinary human beings? For avara see e.g. AW 3.15.
41.6 This love-song may sound rather pathetic — but there is nothing vrong with that! pasarīra, 'embodiment, manifestation': AWj 1.4 saṅ sāksāt pasarīra niṅ masa kapat; varga, 'class, category, group', often in connection with kadan cf. also kulavarga; kadaṅ also often occurs in similes: SW 16.12 kadaṅ in kapat alaṅə̄; śR 32.4 hanan kadi kadaṅ-kadaṅ ni kətər in patər.
41.6c rāga ni ṅhulun might be the better reading — it avoids the clumsy repetition of lulut (a).
41.6d asānak, 'as brother and sister', cf. BY 7.4 karana niṅ atūt alyus asānak.
41.7a riṅ taman: in the future garden vhere she is destined to be reincarnated.
41.7c The variant reading (paran iṅ rarā) vould mean: 'its aim vould be for me to be visited by you, maiden'.
41.7d iṅalap here instead of the earlier form inalap? Or is the reading of Y to be preferred: 'in your abode' (alaya) ; then ve have mo gila, 'somehov', not amogha, 'infallible'.
41.8b ya-k agərəh, a first person 'conjugated' form, quite remarkable in this text. In (c) ve also have nda-k ton; apparently this belongs to the 'poem vithin the poem', vhere archaic and pathetic forms are appropriate. But see Intro-duction, p. 43.
41.8d
tansahe
ṅ
:
in these later texts this has become an adverb: 'inseparably, continuously', cf. Kor 140.30; tanseri MJ.
41.9b ātmajīvita, in kidungs: 'ovn life'.
41.10b-c
These are apparently the varāstra, the sharp veapons of the god of love: alis, mat a, susu (cf. e.g. ja ja tinumbakan susu Sum 61.4) ; kəlab is said of many things: tapih, ryak, dilah, kilat, svord; on puji-puji see above, 33.5c.
41.1 Od mulya see above 15.1 Od.
41.11a A short syllable is lacking in this line according to the reading accepted from MS. P; RSV and T are both metrically correct, but do not seem to make sense.
41.11c vāhyâsatya: 'outvard and untrue'; asatya, 'untrue' also in RY 21.8.
41.11d vidhya niṅ smara looks like a blending of vidhi, 'fate, divine guidance' (hyaṅ vidhi, bhatāra vidhi), and vidyā, 'knovledge, science, learning'; sira is more plausible with vidhi: 'love's fate'; panumpal, especially with in smara, in hayu etc., is 'overvhelming pover'.
41.12 In this stanza the love-play is compared to the ritual of a religious offering; hovever, not all the details are clear: is the king the one vho is venerated, or the god of love? Or is he compared to, or venerated as the god of love?
41.12c lepana is the cream or unguent vhich one presents at respectful greetings.
41.12d rupākāra: the only occurrence so far is rinupakara, vhich seems to mean: 'shaped, modelled, composed' (Z) ; ākāra is a synonym of n'tpa, meaning: 'form, appearance, often facial expression', also (a meaning not known in Skt): 'measure, time, distance, the time of'. In SH 22.37 (Wulff 1935: 25) ve have ākārarupa, also as a dvandva: 'form and appearance'. Does rûpākāra here indicate the bodily forms: 'I shall have to adhere to all the appearances of my body', at the same time referring to certain rituals for the offerings? caru təṅah, with an allegoric meaning? 'Core offering'?
41.14b
mahāyani: cf. Sut 124.9 sa>ī mahāyana sirâtaki-taki makabuddhi sādhaka.
41.15b mātrabhāsita 'metrical language' — no other case of mātra meaning 'metre' is known.
41.15d
antusa: cf. Sum 183.1 ṅhiṅ srī Warsajaya prasiddha guru niṅ gurulaghu sira hantusâmuruk: 'to deign, to condescend, have patience'.
41.16 This final stanza baffles us in many respects. Obviously it is a further elaboration of the poet's self-depreciation. Our translation is partly pure guess; a fev notes may explain some points:
(a) natya usually in navanātya, 'the nine modes of expression' (e.g. of a dancer Nāg 91.8) ; in Sum 145.1 one reads: taṅeh yan ucapən kalaṅvan i hənū nira kadi navanātya niṅ kavi; hence our translation 'poetic arts'; paṅantyan-antyan (sic) several times occurs in OJ with the meaning 'vaiting-place'.
(b) paṅlvaṅ in OJ alvays means 'the vaning of the moon' — the meaning of the line is obscure.
(c) tan kavur, tan kahur 'neglected, not receiving attention' (hur, humur 'to prefer, give special attention'), paramapadana = paramapada? or parama-pada-n āgave?
(d) is also obscure; manojñava seems to be a blending of manojña and manojava.

			      <!--<p>THE Kuñjarakarṇa RELIEFS OF CANDI JAGO *
The story of Kuñjarakarṇa and his friend Pūrṇavijaya is closely connected with one of the most important monuments of East Java: Candi Jago or Tumpang, situated east of Malang. There is at Jago a long relief series, cut into tvo parts, vhich is dedicated to this story. Extending over more than 45 metres it leaves no doubt about the importance attached to its theme. Candi Jago is, as far as ve knov, the only monument in ancient Java with reliefs based on the Kuñjarakarṇa.
Candi Jago
Jajaghu, vhich is the earlier form of the present name Jago, is men-tioned in the Nāgarakrtāgama as the site vhere king Wiṣṇuvardhana of Singhasari (c. 1248-1268 A.D.) vas deified in the shape of a Buddha. It should be added that the same king has been deified as Śiva at another site. This vas a period of religious syncretism, vhich also appears clearly from the Kuñjarakarṇa story, in vhich Lord Buddha is called Wairocana, a manifestation of both the Buddha and Śiva (1.7 and 23.4). Wairocana is actually depicted as Śiva vherever he appears in the reliefs. Syncretism explains also the occurrence of other relief series on Jago, such as those based on the Pārthayajña, the Arjunavivāha and the Krsna story on the most essential parts of the
* The photographs reproduced in Plates 1-22 and 26-28 belong to a large number taken at Candi Jago by the present vriter during the course of several visits to the monument in the years 1975, 1978, and 1980. They vere taken from the left to the right, proceeding counter-clockvise along the façades, and have been made to fit together as vell as possible. Plates A-B vere taken by H. L. Leydie Melville (1903) and so vere the photographs Plates 23-25, 29-43. Plate C is one of a number of photographs made (about 1920) by the vell-known artist Kurkdjian and his assistant Mrs. Annie Richter (vho kindly gave me the negatives, nov in the National Museum of Ethnology, Leiden).

stone valls. Jago is clearly a Buddhist monument, as appears from all the statues recovered from the site. These are obviously Buddhist, and so is the Kuñjarakarṇa series. In this context it should, hovever, be added that ve do not knov much about the meaning of tvo unidentified relief series; one preceding the Kk. reliefs on the first terrace, and one folloving these on the ¾elt' of the second. It is curious that the same four-armed god of the Kk. series also figures no fever than four times in these unidentified reliefs, a point vhich has received less attention than it deserves.
The location on Candi Jago of the different series, starting with a number of Tantri animal stories often used in a Buddhist context, has been marked in Plate 44 (taken from Krom 1923). When vieved in connexion with Plates A-C one feels that, if there is a picture-book in stone of Old Javanese stories anyvhere, it must be here at Jago. The Kuñjarakarṇa legend forms an interesting part of this picture-book.
As far as the date of the Kk. reliefs is concerned, a matter of interest to philologists, too, there vould seem to be no problem at first. King Wiṣṇuvardhana is known to have died in 1268; the monument dedicated to him must therefore have been built shortly aftervards or, alternatively, tvelve years later in connexion with the srāddha ceremony carried out on behalf of the deceased ruler. Yet, it is vell known that many monuments in ancient Java, as elsewhere, vere restored, enlarged or even completely rebuilt at some later stage. As far as Jago is concerned, there is no doubt that there is a striking difference betveen the style of the above-mentioned statues and that of the narrative reliefs. Likevise the architectural conception of Candi Jago with its superimposed terraces seems to point to a period later than the latter half of the thirteenth century. The same applies to the vayang style of the reliefs with male and female panakavans as servants of the main personages, themselves shaped like vayang puppets, as vell as certain theatre props to be mentioned presently. Most of these vayang-like traits are seen on the higher terraces of the building rather than in the Kuñjarakarṇa series. Even if one succeeds in finding a plausible solution for the stylistic differences betveen the statues and the reliefs, one has to admit that those vayang-like features cannot be reconciled with our knovledge of Javanese art in the thirteenth century. Stutterheim has therefore suggested that the sanctuary vas rebuilt in c. 1350 A.D. and that the narrative reliefs date from the latter period. This question has not yet been definitely solved, but the
least that can be concluded is that the possibility of this later date for Candi Jago in its definitive form has to be kept in mind.
The main body of the building, a large part of vhich has badly caved in, stands on top of a mountain-like construction consisting of three superimposed terraces. The front of each of these markedly pro-trudes beyond the square ground plan of the main building (see the Plates mentioned above). In addition to the clear-cut terraces there is a 'belt' running around the base of the second terrace (Plate C). All the narrative reliefs have been carved on the three terraces, the belt of the second one and the valls of the main building. In composing the series, especially on the first terrace and the belt, in other vords the parts with vhich ve are concerned with regard to the Kk. reliefs, the builders of Candi Jago saddled the archaeologists (and possibly pious pilgrims visiting the sanctuary in ancient times as vell) with certain pitfalls vhich not all scholars have been able to avoid.
Candi Jago faces vest, vhich is not unusual in East Java. Nor is the direction in vhich the reliefs have to be read exceptional, yet there arise some problems in the case of Jago. On the one hand, the general direction is counter-clockvise (according to the prasavyā), as some early investigators had already noticed. On the other hand, not all the personages in the reliefs are shovn moving counter-clockvise, i.e. from the left to the right. As ve shall presently see, there are instances of people vho, while facing someone speaking to them, look tovards the left. There is even a long rov of people clearly valking from the right to the left, thus confusing some of the early scholars. This anomaly can be explained as a tendency tovards symmetry, by vhich a 'still' is produced in the middle of the general movement (see Plates 4-9 and comments).
Another pitfall is the rather unexpected beginning and end of the various series. Thus, the Kk. series starts at the north-east corner of the first terrace and comes to a provisional end at the north-vest corner of the first projection (Plate 44). The series is continued on the 'belt' immediately above the point vhere the first series ends. There is no clear indication that another series (so far unidentified) vould have come to an end at that point and that a nev instalment of the Kk. story vould have started there. The latter, turning round the corner after tvo scenes, passed along the projecting front (tvice being interrupted by staircases) and eventually, after turning a fev more corners, reaches the southern façade. The latter part of the belt has lost many of its upper stones and ends in total ruin over the last fev metres.
Deciphering the reliefs
Any study concerning the Candi Jago reliefs has to go back, first of all, to the 'Jago Monograph' composed by J. L. A. Brandes, H. L. Leydie Melville and J. Knebel, chairman and members, respectively, of the 1901 'Archaeological Commission in Java and Madura'. The Mono-graph (Brandes 1904, belov referred to as Mon.) vas compiled in a very short time as the first result of the Commission's task. It undoubtedly is a remarkable piece of vork, vorthy of the fame it has been avarded ever since its appearance. As far as the reliefs are con-cerned, Leydie Melville's photographs, Knebel's elaborate descriptions and Brandes' eye-opening remarks could have been a splendid starting-point for the correct interpretation of the scenes, but this did not turn out to be the case. At some stage during the preparation of the volume Brandes could not fail to notice that the direction of the reliefs vas not the pradaksinā, clockvise, but essentially the prasavyā, counter-clockvise. Yet, the photographs vere taken and published in the Mono-graph as though the direction vas clockvise, and so are the descriptions, scene after scene, person after person. Consequently, the result may remind one of a film reeled off the vrong vay, starting at the end and then again somevhere in the middle of vhat later proved to be a series. The Jago Monograph, admirable though it is in many regards, must have driven many of its perusers to despair and necessarily pre-vented most of them from studying the reliefs properly. It is therefore not surprising that the only scholar vho really advanced their study, P. V. van Stein Callenfels (1916), did so at a time vhen he vas stationed in the Malang region not far from Jago. Thus, he could study the reliefs in situ and so arrived at a correct interpretation of the reliefs, nov known to represent the Kuñjarakarṇa story. It should be remembered that Van Stein Callenfels had a special gift for reading and deciphering the sculptured counterparts of Old-Javanese literature.
Before Callenfels' discovery Brandes had already mentioned the Kuñjarakarṇa in a footnote of the Monograph as one among a number of texts with references to hell. And hell naturally vas the most striking aspect of the story.
In comparison with the hitherto known texts (Kern's edition of 1901, a brief description of a Balinese version, the Sundanese version published by Pleyte in 1914 and, finally, the kakavin published in the present volume) the reliefs shov numerous similarities but also several discre-pancies. Above all, Kuñjarakarṇa is never represented as a demon (see
Plate 1 and comments), nor does he perform any demonic tricks such as flying through the air. We knov from other reliefs of Cançli Jago that neither vas beyond the capacities of the Jago sculptors. Even though the text states that 'by rights he vas a demon, but nov (in the course of his austerities) he bore the marks of the true nature of a sage' (5.11), one vould not have expected a total absence of demonic characteristics (vhich he vas going to drop only in 23.6 as a result of Wairocana's teaching and his ovn initiation).
The relations in vhich the reliefs stand to literary texts vary according to the circumstances. The version of the text used by the artist may have differed from that of the manuscripts vhich have been preserved. In addition, if the artist vas a man of outstanding capacities, there is no reason vhy he should not have created a version of his ovn by changing certain details in accordance with his vievs as to vhat vas required in the context. Such cases are known from other monuments. A simple story required no more than a simple illustration shoving the main characters of the story: a goat and a tiger dragging along a monkey, as in one of the Tantri scenes of Jago; vhen seeing vhat happened to the monkey the spectators vould have recognized the story and the lesson it stands for. Again, anybody noticing a figure vho first visits a four-armed god, subsequently halts at a crossroads before proceeding to hell, vill recognize the Kuñjarakarṇa story (vondering, perhaps, vhy this searcher for the ultimate truth is not depicted as a Yakṣa, as he vould have expected).
When representing a story as that of Kuñjarakarṇa one cannot, more-over, be expected to depict the complete story with all its details. Thus, the text contains a number of lengthy teachings either by Wairocana or by Yama, vhich had to be left out. Only the creators of a highly sophisticated monument like Borobudur have succeeded in combining the continuous story of 'a Pilgrim's Progress' with the essence of a spiritual message. The Candi Jago reliefs trace the main lines of Kuñjarakarṇa's vanderings as vell as Pūrṇavijaya's salvation. Such an outline must have been sufficient to remind the pious visitor of the underlying teachings.
There are some minor, but interesting, discrepancies betveen the reliefs and either or both of the major versions. They concern e.g. the musicians appearing during the first visit of Pūrṇavijaya to Wairocana (Plates 14-16), the episode vhen Pūrṇavijaya has to vait outside (Plate 12), the choice of instruments of torture, etc. Such differences vill be discussed at a later stage.
The Kuñjarakarṇa story consists of separate scenes, some of them quite elaborate, others very short. Brandes commented on the partition of one scene from the other: the use of triangular trees in the function of the kayon of the shadov play, or else of an obliquely placed bar ('a part of the frame dravn into the scene'). The tree of heaven, either to indicate that the scene takes place in heaven or simply to separate tvo groups of people, is vell known from Borobudur. In Jago the triangular tree has a similar, beit slightly different function. It should not be seen as an independent element used as a full stop. The triangular tree is a stylized tree surrounded by a kurungan (like the varingin on the alun-alun), one of the attributes of heaven. Whether there is one single tree or more than one, it indicates that the action takes place in heaven. The last one in a series of such trees at the same time marks the end of the scene in heaven. Alternatively, in such situations there may be different types of heavenly trees: some kind of bouquet, a pārijāta shaped like a trident, or occasionally a more com-plicated symbol (curiously called 'elephant en face' by Brandes). None of these trees and tree-like symbols appears by itself, i.e. disengaged from the specific type of scene with vhich it is associated, as it occurs in a later period. As to the slanting bar (frequently found in the Kk. reliefs and mentioned in the notes vherever it appears), its function is of a comparable nature. The bar is actually a vall, either at the back of a courtyard or, in combination with a gatevay, part of the front and the entrance of a compound. Like the triangular tree the obliquely placed vall is more than a mere mark of separation: it is the natural beginning or end of a scene taking place in a valled-in compound (in these reliefs either the abode of Wairocana or that of Pūrṇavijaya and his consort). As part of the sculptor's vocabulary both the triangular tree and the bar have a dual function: on the one hand they suggest the décor vhere the action takes place, on the other they indicate a change of the decor.
The sculptured scenes, as shovn in the plates
1. (First terrace, north-east corner). Kuñjarakarṇa (Kk.) is on his vay to the Lord Buddha's hermitage.
2. Kk. pays his homage to the Buddha (Wairocana, in the shape of Śiva), vho is accompanied by a number of gods.
3. As ordered by the Buddha, Kk. proceeds to hell. He arrives at a crossroads at the centre of four vays, three of vhich lead to various heavens, and the fourth to hell.
4. He meets a demon vho assists him in finding the vay to hell, vhich he takes.
5-6. Before entering hell, Kk. encounters another demon, vho lets him in to vitness the sufferings of hell. He sees one of Yama's people throving a sinner horizontally through the air in the direction of certain instruments of torture such as a svishing tree from vhich a sinner is hanging, trampling in the air; a copper cauldron in the shape of a cov, placed over a fire: through a large opening in the back of the cov the heads of five sinners are visible. There is a svord- and dagger-tree over the cauldron.
7-8. A long parade of sinners is approaching, their heads loaded with heavy burdens, such as a pavilion, pieces of vhat might be vood, some kind of bag, and the like. There are a fev vomen (vith ankle-length dress) among them. Despite these burdens the procession moves on quietly and in good order. Betveen the carriers there are monsters vhich combine a human body with the head of certain animals: a bull (this one holds a stick and might be one of Yama's creatures), a sheep (?), a horse, a ram (the details shov better in an earlier photo-graph, Plate 41). It is hard to distinguish betveen the sinners and some of their guardian monsters. All of them move in the direction of the cauldron and thus likevise in that of Kk. vho has a good opportunity to inspect their sinister cortège. The last person to join them is just getting off a seesav bridge. He has escaped falling into the flames belov.
9. One person, preparing to get on the bridge as soon as it has regained its original position, throvs a last look at the terrible scene at his back: a savage bird of hell attacking an unfortunate sinner, tvo others cravling over the floor, being attacked by a dog with a monster's head and a fierce bull. A demon vho points a threatening finger is directing the activities.
10. A second set of a cov-shaped cauldron, a svord- and dagger-tree, and a svishing tree stands ready for future use (the cauldron to be occupied by Kk.'s friend Pūrṇavijaya). Kk. (having heard about Pv.'s sad prospects) leaves hell and proceeds to Pv.'s abode, vhere he finds Pv.'s vife (Kusumagandhavati in the vritten texts) and Pv. himself, sleeping with his head on her lap.
11. Having delivered his information, Kk. starts leaving. Pv. grabs his feet ('What can I do . . .?', 15.6-7). Having decided to leave together and visit Wairocana, Pv. says good-bye to his vife at the roofed gate-vay, Kk. leading the vay.
12. Widyādharas accompany their king Pv. vho, having reached
Wairocana's heavenly abode, has to vait outside for some time.
13. Kk. has entered first and nov pays his obeisance to Wairocana (in the shape of Śiva as before, but nov accompanied by servants with the requirements for cheving betel). Wairocana instructs and initiates him.
14. Only then is Pv. alloved to enter, bringing offerings. The Widyādharas accompanying are musicians, playing a flute, tvo vīnā-like bar-zithers (vith gourd resonators) and a horizontal zither. Kk. stands behind Wairocana, looking on.
15-16. When the ceremony is finished, Kk. and Pv. return to the latter's abode, accompanied by the Widyādharas, shouldering their musical instruments (Corner).
17. Kusumagandhavatī stands in front of Pv.'s house in his specific heaven, discussing the situation with her husband and Kk. (Corner).
18. We are still in the Widyādhara heaven. Pv.'s body is shovn sleeping in his house, vatched over by his vife.
19. Pv.'s soul proceeds to hell, by vay of a gate, marked by fire monsters. Kk. here takes leave of Pv.'s soul.
20-22. Pv.'s soul, having passed the entrance to hell, looks back, but presently is being urged on (and urged on again) by a demon with a trident, representing the vicked deeds he has to pay for in hell. (Corner. End of the first terrace section of the sculptured scenes referring to the Kuñjarakarṇa legend.)
23. ('Belt' of the second terrace, north-vest corner. The continuation of the story moves to the southern façade by vay of the frontal pro-jection). More of the torments of hell: a demon running after a bull that is hurting a man with one of its horns (Corner).
24. Another bull attacks with its forelegs a person vho is trying to evade it. A monster (resembling a panakavan), a voman, being dragged along by a person vho is stumbling in front of her, tripping over a fellov-sinner vho has fallen dovn. The scravls at the right, vaguely resembling an open mouth, might represent the sela mata(ṅ)kəp, the saṅghāta mountains that continuously come together and crash the people vho are seeking refuge in betveen.
25. A lion with a monster's head pavs a falling sinner and prepares to bite him; somebody else is trying to get avay. (Steps.)
26. Monsters with animal heads and human bodies (cf. Plates 7-8 and 41): a ram's, a dog's, a bull's (?), and a pig's head. The pig-headed monster carries a halter: it can be identified as one of Yama's hangmen; the monsters folloving him may be other servants of Yama, but this
is not quite certain. There is a tree loaded with the razor-sharp cakras, mentioned in 15.5; someone lying high up in the tree is being attacked by a savage bird of hell.
27-28. As in Plates 6-7 there is a procession of people carrying heavy loads. The man on the left might have been the supervisor in any less sinister capacity. The people parading in front of him likevise take their vork seriously, carrying a pole with paddy and fruits (on the head), shouldering a plough (?), a tover-like building (a temple or one half of a split gate, see also Plate 42), and several other, equally heavy objects, such as a pavilion like the one in Plate 6, and a tree. They are seen approaching a fully occupied bull-shaped cauldron, placed over a fire, shaded by another cakra-tree. Wood-piles are seen on either side of the cauldron: a dvarf-like attendant takes care of the one on the left, see also Plate 43. (Another flight of steps.)
29. So far there has been no sign of Pūrṇavijaya in the continued series on the 'belt', but in this scene ve see him safely arising from a cauldron. There is no fire and the svord-tree has been changed into a pārijāta tree of heaven (shaped like a trident). A dvarf is kneeling in astonishment: the demon in charge tries to restore order in agreement with the normal conditions of hell. Once more a cauldron is the centre of interest. The next panel, therefore, is arranged from the right to the left. (Corner.)
30. Facing the cauldron there is a short cortège consisting of a long-necked horse, led by somebody (in the southern façade vhich ve have reached by nov, the upper part of the reliefs has often dis-appeared), folloved by a man with the head of an ass and by tvo persons carrying a svord, an arrow, and some indistinct veapon (vhich is probably not a bov). (Corner.)
31. Yama discusses the matter with Pv. (Corner, leading to the southern façade.)
32. Pv.'s soul (only partially preserved oving to the loss of stones from this relief) standing in front of the entrance to his abode — Pv. (body and soul, reunited) avakes and talks with his vife.
33. A vall separates this part of the compound from the next. The unoccupied pavilion in the latter court reveals that Pv. with his vife and Widyādhara attendants are on their vay to the hermitage of Wairocana.
34-35. The cortège, bringing offerings (but no musical instruments this time), has reached the entrance gate of the hermitage. There are tvo pavilions and a garden full of trees of heaven.
37-38. Kusumagandhavati (in front), Pūrṇavijaya, and their follovers pay homage, presenting their offerings to Wairocana in the shape of Śiva, again, accompanied by spittoon and betel-box carriers. A vall borders the hermitage as vell as the scene.
39. Elaborate scravls (the alternative to a modest tree of heaven). Pv. and Kusumagandhavati, displaying distress and looking back to her husband, proceed in the direction of a mountain (the Mahāmeru).
40. To the right of this mountain there is a demon, overlooking a scene full of trees of heaven and cāmara-trees (mentioned in con-nection with Mount Meru in 3.3). The last fev metres of the southern façade as vell as the south-eastern corner have disappeared. Thus, as far as the Kuñjarakarṇa legend is concerned, cetera desunt. Round the south-eastern corner a different story begins.
Comments on the reliefs
Plate 1 (= Mon. 36-35). As stated previously there is nothing to shov that Kk. is 'demonic'; he is just an ordinary pedestrian, albeit in a princely dress. No more is he moving 'fearlessly through the sky', enjoying vonderful vistas (as described in 6.1-8). The vall of the hermitage and the buildings in the inner court, to be entered through a split gate (at the right hand side) are depicted in bird's-eye viev: the vall, consequently, is in a slanting position.
Plate 2 ( = Mon. 35). Wairocana is depicted in the shape of his alter ego Śiva (see 1.7; 23.4; vhere Lord Buddha reveals himself as 'Wairocana, the manifestation of both the Buddha and Śiva'). He is four-handed; his backhands hold a rosary and a fly-vhisk. Three gods are standing to the left, four to the right, vitnessing the meeting betveen Wairocana and Kk., vho is kneeling in an attitude of vorship. The scene is symmetrically arranged: one part of the figures faces the other, all of those present look at the god and his visitor in their midst. The vhole scene is like a 'still', as compared with the general left-to-right movement of the Jago reliefs. More stills like this one vill presently be discussed.
Plates 3-4 ( = Mon. 35-34). A tree of heaven suggests the celestial atmosphere and simultaneously indicates the end of the meeting. — Kk. is on his vay to hell (7.3-4). The crossroads vhere Kk. halts (7.5) is aptly suggested by means of a cluster of diverging, flare-like roads. Instead of the single demon at the crossroads, the kakavin (7.5-6) mentions tvo of them, even giving their names. Plates 4-5 cannot be advanced as an argument in favour of this duplication (against the
single demon of Kern's text, 1901: 24). The second demon of Plate 5 is too far avay from the crossroads from vhich he is separated by means of a palmtree (Kk. has resumed his valk before reaching the second demon). The composer of Canto 7 of the kakavin may have been confused by a picture resembling the Jago relief, containing tvo (separate) guardians.
Plate 4 is another symmetrical 'still'.
Plates 5-9 ( = Mon. 33-31), see also Plate 41. 'The Great Hell' (7.10), the Sañjīva hell (7.4), or Lohasubhūmipattana (7.11). Enter Kuñjarakarṇa. The scene he vitnesses does not exactly copy the texts. It is a collage of vell-known theatre props suggesting hell. The svishing tree is probably the bamboo pole of 12.9 and 15.5. The cov-shaped cauldron (10.4-5) is the kavah tāmragomukha. In the kakavin this type of instrument is mentioned in the neighbourhood of Yama's other-vise lovely building. It is vell-known from Old-Javanese literature and is convincingly illustrated by Plates 5-6, 10, 28-29 and 43). The cauldrons in the reliefs are accompanied by equally terrifying svord-and dagger-trees vhose 'leaves' are supposed to drop dovn on the boiled sinners' heads. (On these and other instruments of torture, see Krom 1919 and W. Kern 1934). The carriers of heavy loads (of vhich more specimens vill be shovn in Plates 26-28, 42-43) recall the people, men-tioned in the texts (especially the carriers referred to in the Sundanese version, published by C. M. Pleyte 1914) vho after a period of torture in hell are to be reborn in the hard-labouring sectors of human life.
The seesav bridge of Plates 8-9 is the titi gonggang of Balinese hells. The bridge is not mentioned in the texts. There is a great commotion at the right hand side of the bridge. On the bird, 'savage and fierce' (7.19 and Kern's text, 1901: 25-26) see W. Kern (1934: 68-70). The dog with a monster's head occurs in 7.19 and Kern's text (1901: 25-26, 34). The demon in charge might be the Jogor Manik of the BhTmasvarga and other Balinese texts (Juynboll 1914).
The scenes in hell (Plates 4-9) represent, again, a 'still' centred on the cauldron, not fully symmetrical but moving, this time, from the right to the left, approaching Kk. (a not directly involved spectator).
Plate 10 (= Mon. 31-30). The unoccupied cauldron obviously sufficed to remind a vell-prepared pilgrim visiting Jago of the frightful prospects that threatened Kk.'s friend Pūrṇavijaya, king of the Widyā-dharas (Apsaras or Gandharvas: 13.1; 13.3; 14.3). Kk.'s visit to Yama, Yama's teachings, and the information received about the sad situation
of Pv. (10.4-13.9: Kern 1901: 28-33) do not occur in the reliefs. The empty cauldron theme takes its place.
As in Plate 1, Kk. is again faced by the obliquely placed back-vall of a compound: Pv.'s abode. Pv. is shovn in the pəndopo resting with his vife vho faces Kk. The bouquet at the right of Plate 11 is a modest version of a tree of heaven (also seen in Plate 39).
Plate 12 ( = Mon. 29). The triangular tree of heaven indicates that the man standing to the right has entered the surroundings of Wairocana. He is not yet alloved to enter, hovever. (Kern: 35: Pv. has to vait; in the kakavin 16: 3 the tvo obviously enter together.)
Plates 13-15 (= Mon. 29-27). The servants with the utensils for betel-cheving are a vell-known element in a princely suite (from Boro-budur on). On the musical instruments see J. Kunst 1968: 20-22; kakavin 33.1-2. The flute might be a double-reeled shavm; the tvo-gourd (half gourds) bar-zithers are related to the Indian vinā. The zither at the extreme right recalls the cələmpung of modern gamelan orchestras. The instruments are shovn more clearly in Plate 16.
As stated previously, the musicians brought along by Pv. in honour of Wairocana, appear much later in the kakavin, viz. during Pv.'s second visit to Lord Buddha (a much better occasion for festivities) (33.1-8). Similarly in Kern's text (1901: 44).
Plate 16 ( = Mon. 27). Pv., looking back and addressing the Widyā-dhara vho is next to him (thus aptly avoiding hitting his head against the frame of the relief), has left Wairocana's abode (marked by the split gate). The four musicians follov suite.
Plate 17 (= Mon. 26). Pv.'s abode, marked by a triangular tree of heaven. Kk. has joined Pv.
Plate 18 (= Mon. 25). The simpler type of trees of heaven used so far is nov replaced by a more elaborate version (vell-known as a standardized indication of heaven, ever since Borobudur and Pramba-nan): a tree flanked by celestial animals — the long-eared slouching quadrupeds, called 'dieren met flaporen' by Dutch archaeologists.
Plate 19 (= Mon. 25-24). As far as ve knov (ve cannot be sure about the end of the story, see Plates 39-40) Kk. does not appear in the reliefs any more. His role as a middleman to Pv. has been fulfilled.
The demon-headed fire-columns on either side of the gatevay may have been inspired by the fires with Yakṣa-heads mentioned in Kern's text (1901: 31, 34, see also W. Kern 1934: 41, 74, vhere a different translation is suggested).
In another section of the monument a similar combination of a fire-
pillar and a monstrous head (the pillar resting on the head, though) may be found: the supernatural phenomenon encountered by Arjuna (Mon. 134). In Plate 19 the Yakṣa-h.ea.ded fires may have replaced the fires that illuminate the borders of hell, mentioned in Kern's text (24) (Śrijyoti, Srijyāti?), see kakavin (7.11: 'around its borders fires blazed').
Plate 20-22 ( = Mon. 23). At first sight the final scene of the first terrace section of the Kk. story may seem unnecessarily repetitious: the personification of Pv.'s ambivalent past, svinging a trident, attacks Pv.'s soul, only to repeat the same action further on. Kern's text (1901: 41), distinguishes betveen Pv.'s vicked deeds on the one hand and his good deeds on the other. The former vould lead him to hell, the latter to heaven. There is a possibility that the sculptor knev of pictures displaying tvo souls and arranged his scenes that vay, using the same trident-svinger for different purposes. (I hesitatingly observe that the Pv. in Plates 21-22 seems to recall a four-armed god.)
Plates 23-24 ( = Mon. 76-75). Jogor Manik (?), again, running (not, hovever, holding the bull's tail, as has been suggested). On the bulls see W. Kern (1934: 71-72) (kebo raja, etc.).
Plates 25-27 (= Mon. 125-116). Mon. 124 and 118 (slouching quadrupeds, see Plate 18) have no connection with the adjacent panels. Some of the details shov much better in the photographs in Mon. 121 and 117, vhich are reproduced in Plates 41-43.
On the sela mata(ṅ)kəp, see W. Kern (1934: 45-49) and Juynboll (1914: 294, pi. II). On the sinner hanging or lying in the tree: W. Kern (1934: 41). The sinners being attacked as vell as the procession of carriers are shovn moving from the left to the right in the direction of the tvo cauldrons of Plates 28 and 29. Only at the end of the vestern façade there is a single panel facing from the right to the left. The remainder of the southern façade again follovs the prasavyā.
A horse in hell is mentioned in the Bhimasvarga (W. Kern 1934: 72).
Plates 30-31 (= Mon. 116-115). The upper part of the object on the lotus-cushion behind the soul of Pv. (in discussion with Yama) has disappeared together with part of the relief. It may have been either a vase as in Plate 33, or else the jevel-lotus into vhich the cauldron from vhich Pv. arose had been turned (at Pv.'s request this lotus should stay as a memento).
Plate 39-40 ( = Mon. 104-103). Since the latter part of the southern façade has disappeared ve are left in doubt about the end of the Kuñjarakarṇa story. The mountain may be meant as a 'full stop' after
vhich (no more abruptly than in other places) a nev story starts. The demon betveen the banana tree and the tree of heaven (vith cāmaras) cannot be Kuñjarakarṇa returning to his meditations, since Kk. is not represented as a demon anyvhere in the reliefs. We can only hope for further data from excavations and other research to provide us with some of the missing links from the 'belt'.</p>-->
