            <p n="1">There is an observance originating from the place of purification<note>The meanings of <foreign>parahupan</foreign> given in OJED (s.v.) are ‘washing-place’ and ‘person from whom one seeks purification’. This form is only attested in PYñ 8.13, where it is also referred to the Lord (Cause), <foreign>bhaṭāra kāraṇa</foreign>. A more liberal translation of mine is adapted to the context of this line, which characterizes yoga as a means of cleansing or purification.</note> that is the yoga of the Lord Guru. The servant of the Truth, he who desires to escape rebirth, should devote his full attention to it, in order to obtain success in spiritual knowledge<foreign>—just like when</foreign>  [one] cooks rice in the morning and eats [it] in that morning, cooks rice at noon and eats [it] in that noon, and cooks rice at night and eats it in that night.<note>The simile here conveys the message that one should act quickly in carrying out these observances in order for them to be effective.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">There is the observance that is greatly powerful, whose head is truth<note>The word <foreign>śirna</foreign>, attested in both manuscripts, is a participle literally means ‘(Skt broken, crushed, shattered; withered, faded, decayed) destroyed, shattered’ (OJED; in Modern Javanese, also ‘disappeared, vanished’). To adapt the occurrence of this word to the context, I emended it to <foreign>śīrṣa</foreign>, ‘’.</note>, greatly purifying, [to be carried out] during the bright half of the lunar month: that should be called ‘austerity’<note>
                  <foreign>Tapa</foreign> means ‘religious austerity, bodily mortification, penance, asceticism’ (OJED). According to the <foreign>Dharma Patañjala</foreign>, <foreign>tapa</foreign> is actually part of the particular commandments (<foreign>niyama</foreign>) in yoga, which are explained as follows: ‘one should strive to inflict pain upon all the senses with observances and absorption, so that he will not become full of passion when he sees the objects of the senses. That is to say: he is not elated if he listens to a pleasant song, or to an orchestra,188 [or if] his tongue causes him to strive after food, if the food tastes good’ (Acri 2017: 310-311).</note>, which brings about auspiciousness. One should carry out control of the passions.</p>
            <p n="2.1">
               <foreign>Śravaṇa</foreign> (July-August): one should not eat any kinds of tubers. Its result is steadiness in strength,<note>I interpret the word <foreign>lәkәn</foreign> as a having a meaning akin to Modern Javanese <foreign>leken</foreign> ‘steady, reliable’ (dialectal) (JED). Another interpretation is possible, on the basis of the Old Javanese root  <foreign>lәk</foreign>: 1. ‘deprived of strength (energy, courage, lustre); dejected, downcast, disheartened, despondent; fatigued, weary; sullen, morose, unwilling’, leading to a translation of <foreign>lәkən kaśaktin</foreign>as ‘shall be deprived (pass. irr.) of strength’. However, considering the overall context of the passage, the Modern Javanese meaning seems to be more suitable.</note> lack of arrogance.<note>I interpret the word <foreign>rәṅka</foreign> in this passage as deriving from <foreign>prәṅkan</foreign> in Old Javanese, which means ‘boastful, arrogant?’ (OJED <ref target="http://sealang.net/archives/ojed/djvu/unbundle.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=1420&amp;zoom=width">1420:4</ref>). The word <foreign>rәṅka</foreign> in Balinese means ‘greedy.’  </note> The Lord Śrī Vvadi Roma comes. </p>
            <p n="2.2">
               <foreign>Bhādravada</foreign> (August-September): one should not eat beef. Its result is not being affected by disease.<note>The word <foreign>sasab</foreign>, which I interpret as a variant of the word <foreign>sabsab</foreign>in Old Javanese, actually means ‘disease (of crops)’ (OJED), but in the light of the present context, i.e. the fruit of an observance carried out by humans, I translate this word as ‘diseases’.  </note> The Lord Dhana descends.</p>
            <p n="2.3">
               <foreign>Asuji</foreign> (September-October): one should not eat pork.  Its result is not being affected by serious illness, then [gaining] beauty. The Lord Padma is firmly established within the body.</p>
            <p n="2.4">
               <foreign>Kārttika</foreign> (October-november): one should not eat any leaves. Its result is abundance in (every) hand-print.<note>I have emended the word <foreign>vvadi</foreign> into <foreign>vrәddhi,</foreign> assuming that the author/copyist forgot to write the <foreign>akṣara ra</foreign> and vocalization <foreign>ә</foreign> while copying the text. The word <foreign>vvadi</foreign> means ‘the depths, the hidden part, the deepest (the real) meaning, the actual significance, the secret’ (OJED), while  <foreign>vrәddhi</foreign> means ‘(Skt growth, increase, advancement, welfare, prosperity, success; the 11th yoga)’ (OJED), hence my translation. This sentence is also potentially translatable as ‘growth [in] all [that is] touched by [one’s] hand’.</note> The Lord Dameṅ Dara is firmly established within the body. </p>
            <p n="2.5">
               <foreign>Mārgaśira</foreign> (November-December): one should neither travel nor stay overnight far away or nearby. Its result is [being] rich in children in the family. The Lord Ṣepa is firmly established within the body.</p>
            <p n="2.6">
               <foreign>Posya</foreign> (December-January): one should not spoil children.<note> I translate <foreign>rare</foreign>as ‘children’, but the meaning could also be ‘child’.</note> Its result is being trusted and obeyed by the children. The Lord Vanu is firmly established within the body.</p>
            <p n="2.7">
               <foreign>Māgha</foreign> (January-February):  <sic>
                  <foreign>sira pañca</foreign>
               </sic>
               <note> The phrase within cruxes (<foreign>sira pañca</foreign> in the text) has an unclear meaning in this sentence. Remarkably, this is the only paragraph that features the pronoun <foreign>sira</foreign>marking the subject, which is expressed by means of an impersonal verbal construction in the other paragraphs. As for the word <foreign>pañca</foreign>, it has several meanings, namely: 1 <foreign>pañca</foreign>I ‘(Skt) five . . . 2. <foreign>mañca</foreign>, <foreign>saṅ amañca</foreign>, <foreign>para mañca</foreign>(<foreign>parâmañca</foreign>?) a functionary or official of high rank . . . 3. <foreign>pañca</foreign>II (Skt <foreign>mañca</foreign>: stage or platform on a palace or on columns, raised seat, dais; platform or shed raised on bamboos in a field)’ (OJED s.v.). Apparently, only the meaning of ‘five’ is appropriate in this context.  I assume that the copyist most likely wanted to write the words <foreign>sira pañca</foreign>after the word <foreign>mārga</foreign> in paragraph 1.5 above, in order to specify that <foreign>mārga</foreign>is the fifth month/observance in the list. Alternatively, the copyist might have wanted to write the word <foreign>sira</foreign>after the <foreign>marga</foreign>so that it became <foreign>margasira</foreign>, i.e., the fifth month or <foreign>pañca</foreign>. However, this possibility is doubtful because there is the only instance in the text where this type of gloss occurs next to the name of a month.</note> one should not eat unclean [food], any kind of unclean [food]. Its result is knowing about everything in the universe.<note> I conjecturally emended <foreign>saṅgaṅani</foreign>in both manuscripts to <foreign>sahanani</foreign>(<foreign>jagat</foreign>), which in the context of the fruit of observances could refer to a supernatural faculty of omniscience (i.e., knowing everything that exists in the universe), akin to the three faculties of <foreign>dūraśravaṇa</foreign>, <foreign>dūradarśaṇa</foreign>, and <foreign>dūrāsarvajñāna</foreign>described in <foreign>tutur</foreign>s, like the <foreign>Dharma Pātañjala</foreign>(see Acri 2017: 284-285).</note> The Lord Suvindha is firmly established within the body. </p>

               <foreign>Phālguna</foreign> (February-March): one should not eat meat of quadrupeds. Its result is [becoming] rich in domestic animals. The Lord Humava is firmly established within the body. </p>
            <p n="2.9">
               <foreign>Cetra</foreign> (March-April): one should not eat dog [meat]. Its result is beauty without make-up. The Lord Viṣṇu is firmly established within the body.</p>

               <foreign>Āṣādha</foreign> (June-August): one should neither sleep with his wife, nor buy [a woman in wedding]<note> Generally the word <foreign>panuku</foreign> means ‘that which one buys’ (OJED). My translation ‘not buy [a woman in wedding]’ is justified by the following passage in the <foreign>Ādiparva</foreign> (112.7): <foreign>mavvat sarvadṛvya panukva ri saṅ Mādrī</foreign>, ‘bring all properties for buying [a woman in a wedding] with Mādri’, which seems to reflect a similar context.</note>. The Lord Manatas is firmly established within the body. </p>
            <p n="3">There is an observance when one eats on a leaf plate, called  enjoying a leaf (<foreign>amukti patra</foreign>). The reverend Pakirṇna is firmly established within the body. Its result is that, if one is [ritually] ending [his life], one accomplishes a good death, not by means of a sword.<note> The unattested form <foreign>pinaruputan</foreign>apparently derives from <foreign>paruput</foreign>, ‘end, culmination (cf. <foreign>puput</foreign>)’ (OJED). The context seems to refer to the end of life or of a war.  In Balinese, the word  <foreign>puputan</foreign>, which might be related to the stem <foreign>paruput</foreign>, refers to ‘ritual suicide of the court of the Raja of Badung that took place on September 20, 1906, when a Dutch army advanced upon Denpasar from Sanur’ (BASAbali Wiki.org s.v.). This would support my hypothesis that <foreign>pinaruputan</foreign>refers to a form of ritual suicide (for a form of yogic death that is repeatedly mentioned in Old Javanese texts, i.e. <foreign>sadyotkrānti</foreign>, see Acri …) . Alternatively, <foreign>paruput</foreign>could be related to <foreign>parupuh,</foreign>‘to overpower, overwhelm, flood with’ (OJED), which would yield the following translation: ‘if one is overpowered, one accomplishes a good death …’. Even in this case, the context appears to be that of ritual or yogic suicide preventing death by means of a sword, which would have been perceived negatively in premodern Javanese and Balinese cultures.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">There is the observance of eating leaves (<foreign>apatrāhāra)</foreign>: one eats leaves continuously. The deity is the reverend Iśvara. Its result is to reach the heaven of the Lord Guru. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one reaches the heaven of the Lord brahmā and the Lord Visnu.</p>
            <p n="5">There is the observance of eating leaves with a companion (<foreign>akarvan pattrāhāra</foreign>)<note> ‘With a companion’ is my free translation of <foreign>akarvan</foreign>. The literal meaning of <foreign>akarvan</foreign> is ‘being two together, being together with, sharing st. (with another)’ (OJED). In Bahasa Indonesia, the word <foreign>akarvan</foreign> could be rendered as <foreign>berdua</foreign>.</note>. Its appointed duration is seven years. Its result is to reach the heaven of reverend Iśvara. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a vendor of clothes,<note> Both manuscripts read <foreign>bhāṣana</foreign> (probably by contamination with <foreign>bhāṣa</foreign>), which I have silently standardised to <foreign>basana</foreign> ‘clothes’ (from Sanskrit <foreign>vasana</foreign>).</note> rich in servants, [and] successful with the king.<note> Alternatively, one could divide the phrase as <foreign>sasarnya ajanma riṅ juru basana</foreign>
                  <foreign>sugih</foreign>, <foreign>hulun labdha ri saṅ prabhu</foreign>, yielding the translation ‘[alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a rich vendor of clothes, a successful servant of the king.’</note>
            </p>
            <p n="6">There is the observance of the golden ladle (<foreign>akaṇakadarva</foreign>):  one should eat rice mixed with turmeric. Its appointed duration is three years. Its result is reaching the heaven of the reverend Mahādeva. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a rich ship captain.</p>
            <p n="7">There is the observance of the crimson (<foreign>arakta</foreign>): one should eat black glutinous rice<note>The black glutinous rice seeds have a blackish crimson colour.</note>. Its result is reaching the heaven of the Lord Viṣṇu.  [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a rich minister<foreign>.</foreign>
            </p>
            <p n="8">There is the observance of the millet grain (<foreign>ajavala</foreign>)<note> This word is not found in OJED. I assume that the <foreign>ajavala</foreign> could be an abbreviated adjectival form (<foreign>a</foreign>-) of the Old Javanese expression <foreign>java jali</foreign> meaning ‘millet grain (<foreign>Eleusine coracana</foreign>)’ (OJED).</note>: one eats millet grains continuously. [Its result is reaching] the heaven of Lord Iśvara. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a powerful priest, a Śaiva [or] Buddhist brahmin. </p>

               </sic> (of the bamboo shoot?)<note> I am unable to propose a convincing emendation of the words <foreign>hanrimbhu</foreign>and <foreign>hanәr̥mbu</foreign> in mss. A and B, respectively. However, the portions  <foreign>rimbhu</foreign>and <foreign>r̥mbu</foreign> are apparently related to <foreign>әbuṅ</foreign>, ‘bamboo shoot’ (OJED), occurring in the same paragraph.</note>: one does not eat any kinds of bamboo shoots. Its appointed duration is one year. [Its result is] reaching [the heaven] of the reverend Rudra. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn in the family of the king, [or in a] noble family. </p>
            <p n="10">There is the observance of twelfth month (<foreign>Aṅaṣādha</foreign>)<note>Around June-August in the Gregorian calendar.</note>: one is fasting on every full moon day of the twelfth month [for] three [successive] years. Its result is reaching [the heaven] of the reverend Indra. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a perfectly beautiful [person], happy in the future, smart, and rich since childhood. </p>
            <p n="11">There is the observance of the seventh month (<foreign>Aṅapitu</foreign>)<note> Around January-February in the Gregorian calendar.</note>: one is fasting in the seventh month [for] three [successive] years. Its result is reaching [the heaven] of the reverend brahmā. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a rich [person] since childhood, and perfectly beautiful. </p>
            <p n="12">There is the observance of <foreign>Kalivon</foreign> (<foreign>Aṅalivon</foreign>): one should carry out fasting three times on the day of Saturday <foreign>Kalivon</foreign> three times [in a row]. Its result is the obtainment of [the object of] one’s efforts; one who is striving for gold and silver obtains them abundantly.</p>
            <p n="13">There is the observance of tenth month (<foreign>akedusiṅ</foreign>)<note> In harmony with some of the observance listed above, such as that of the twelfth month called <foreign>Aṅasadha</foreign>‘, that of the  seventh month called <foreign>Aṅapitu</foreign>, and that of the <foreign>Klivon</foreign>called <foreign>Aṅalivan</foreign>, I assume that the form <foreign>akedusiṅ</foreign>is related to <foreign>kadasa</foreign>(<foreign>kadaśa</foreign>), meaning ‘tenth month’ (around April-May in the Gregorian calendar). This is confirmed by the occurrence of <foreign>kasapuluh</foreign>, ‘tenth‘ (month), in the explanation of the observance in this paragraph.</note>: one fasts every full moon day of the tenth month (<foreign>kasapuluh</foreign>), and one should do that for three tenth months [consecutively]. Its result is reaching [the heaven] of reverend Iśvara. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a powerful priest, a Śaiva [or] Buddhist brahmin. </p>
            <p n="14">There is the observance of not criticizing anything that is eaten, and also any actions [whether pure or impure, committed by any persons]. It is called <foreign>Brata Sambә</foreign>
               <note> The OJED does not gloss the word <foreign>sambә,</foreign> but we find <foreign>sumambә ‘</foreign>(app. describing the state of a corpse:) nothing but the trunk <foreign>sinambә</foreign> idem?’</note>. <foreign>Sambә</foreign> means the power of love (compassion). <sic>… <foreign>deva maśih</foreign> …</sic>
               <note> The phrase within cruxes (<foreign>deva maśih</foreign>) makes the structure of the sentence different than in the preceding paragraphs, and suggests that a portion of this paragraph went missing in the course of transmission, because of the occurrence of (<foreign>viryya</foreign>) māśih immediately before, which could have triggered a mistake of the type ‘saut du même au même’. Its translation, ‘god loves [a successful minister]’, does not seem to be appropriate in this context.</note> a successful minister, a perfectly beautiful person, and a rich person since childhood.</p>
            <p n="15">There is the observance that is difficult to achieve (<foreign>adurlabha</foreign>)<note>I have emended the word <foreign>adurla</foreign> into <foreign>adurlabha</foreign>(Skt ‘difficult to be obtained or found, hard, scarce, rare’ MW). This emendation seems to be supported by a passage of the <foreign>Tattva Brata</foreign>found in ms. Pusat Dokumentasi Kebudayaan Bali describing an observance named  <foreign>ndurga</foreign>along similar lines: <foreign>hana bratta ndurgga, ṅa, hamaṅan skul jali, limāṅ lek ṣamayanya, pha, mantukiṁ svārgga bhaṭāra viṣṇu, sasārnya mañjanmā riṁ viku bahu sisya (7r)</foreign>, ‘there is the observance that is difficult to achieve (<foreign>ndurga</foreign>): one eats rice mixed with finger millet. Its appointed duration is five months. Its result is reaching the heaven of the Lord Viṣṇu. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a priest who has many disciples.’ The word <foreign>durlabha</foreign>and <foreign>durga</foreign> are near-synonyms (<foreign>durga</foreign>: ‘difficult of access or approach, impassable, unattainable’, OJED). Alternatively, one could emend <foreign>durla</foreign>to <foreign>durga</foreign>, assuming that the copyist mistakenly wrote <foreign>la</foreign>instead of <foreign>ga</foreign>, the two <foreign>akṣara</foreign>s being similar in the Merapi-Merbabu (and Balinese) scripts.</note>: one eats [only] rice mixed with finger millet. Its appointed duration is five months. Its result is reaching the heaven of reverend Viṣṇu. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a priest who has many disciples.</p>
            <p n="16">There is the observance of ninth month (<foreign>Aṅasaṅa</foreign>): one fasts on every full moon day of the ninth month <foreign>(Kasaṅa</foreign>), and one should do that [on the full moon day of] three consecutive ninth months. Its result is reaching the heaven of the reverend Indra. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a beautiful, smart, and rich person from childhood.</p>
            <p n="17">There is the observance of single intention (<foreign>aṅekapakṣa</foreign>): one eats once a day. Its appointed duration is one year. Its result is the success of efforts. You will be famous, and all of your undertakings will be successful.</p>
            <p n="18">There is the observance of the earth-leaf (<foreign>bhūmipatra</foreign>): one eats on earth as a plate. Its appointed duration is one year. Its result is being welcomed (received) by scholars. The [amount of one’s] land is increased, [and] one has many relatives [and] kin.</p>
            <p n="19">There is the observance of chewing betel without turning [its leaf upside down]. Its appointed duration is one year. Its result is one will be fitted with a loincloth by a woman<note> The phrase <foreign>cinavәtaniṅ istri</foreign>, which means ‘one will be fitted with a loincloth by a woman’, probably is an analogy for one who will be served, respected, and loved by his wife. </note>. [Also,] the poison will not be effective [on him]. </p>
            <p n="20">There is the observance of not drinking water after having eaten. Its result is that all your undertakings are fulfilled<note> As there is no explanation about the technique to perform this observance, the deity, and the appointed duration of the observance in this passage, it is possible that a portion of text was mistakenly dropped in the course of transmission.</note>.</p>
            <p n="21">There is the observance of the copper-pot leaf (<foreign>dhaṅ patra</foreign>):  a lotus<note> I have emended <foreign>kama</foreign> in both manuscripts into <foreign>kamala</foreign> ‘lotus, Nelumbium’ (OJED). The meaning probably is that the leaves themselves are cooked in the copper-pot instead of proper food, and not used as material on which to put the food, i.e. as a food tray.</note> leaf including its stalk is [one’s] main dish<note>Literally <foreign>ivak</foreign> means ‘fish and (rarely) meat’ (OJED). In this context, I translate it as ‘a main dish’.</note>. Its appointed duration is one year. [Its result] is being rich, having many pleasures, and being perfect in beauty.  </p>
            <p n="22">There is the observance of sleeping [only] once [and] not sleeping again after waking up. Its result is that one will not be affected by illness.</p>
            <p n="23">There is the observance of having one [measure of] food (<foreign>aṅekāhāra</foreign>)<note> I have emended the word <foreign>aṅeka</foreign>in both manuscripts into <foreign>aṅekāhāra</foreign>in the light of the previous occurrence of the observance called <foreign>brata apatrāhāra</foreign>’the observance of eating leaves’ above. This emendation is easy to justify philologically since the word following thereupon, i.e. <foreign>haranya</foreign>, could have caused a mistake of the type ‘saut du même au même’. It is also supported by the explanation of the observance as ‘one eats a handful of food per day’, where the word  <foreign>aṅeka</foreign>has a close relation to both ‘a handful’ and ‘a day’.</note>: one eats a handful of food per day. Its appointed duration is seven days. Its result is that the effort yields [fruit] quickly. </p>
            <p n="24">There is the observance of Sunday (<foreign>Araditya</foreign>):<note> I have conjecturally emended <foreign>haranyithya</foreign>in ms. A and <foreign>aharanyitya</foreign>in ms. B into <foreign>araditya</foreign>‘Sunday’, on account of the occurrence of the word <foreign>raditya</foreign>in the explanation.</note> one performs fast on Sunday. Its results are an iron-body<note>For the translation of <foreign>vajra</foreign>as ‘iron’, see Acri forthcoming, and compare such expressions as <foreign>bajrakāya</foreign>, occurring in the Old Javanese <foreign>Rāmāyaṇa</foreign>VIII.30 (Supomo, 1980: 207) and <foreign>vajraśarīra</foreign>in the Talang Tuwo inscription (line 12; see Siregar 2018: 81). An alternative would be to read <foreign>avakbajra</foreign>, i.e. <foreign>a</foreign>+<foreign>vak</foreign>+<foreign>bajra</foreign>, meaning ‘[one’s] words are [as strong as] iron’; however, the present context, mentioning invincibility against enemies, makes it a less likely option.</note>, [becoming] a successful minister, [and] winning over enemies.</p>
            <p n="25">There is the triple observance (<foreign>tridhā</foreign>):<note>An alternative emendation could be <foreign>tritaya</foreign>(involving the loss of <foreign>a</foreign>after <foreign>d</foreign>and the transformation into a consonantal cluster), meaning ‘a triad’ in Sanskrit. In any event, it is virtually certain that a word meaning ‘threefold’, ‘three times’, ‘three’, or something similar, is meant.</note> one takes a bath three times everyday.<note>The expression <foreign>rahina vәṅi</foreign>(literally ‘day and night’) in Old Javanese means something along the lines of ‘everyday’ or ‘at all times’.</note> Its appointed duration is seven months. Its results are great happiness, [and becoming] wise and judicious without comparison.</p>
            <p n="26">There is the observance of not taking a bath and not applying oil. Its appointed duration is three months. Its result is that many people are affectionate towards [the practitioner]. </p>
            <p n="27">There is the observance of the three times (<foreign>trisamaya</foreign>): one should practice eating three handfuls of food per day. Its appointed duration is three nights.<note>The text seems to be slightly inconsistent, as one would expect three days, given that the prescribed amount of food is to be eaten during a day. The emendation of the word <foreign>ṣavәṅi</foreign> in ms. A and  <foreign>śavṅi</foreign> in ms. B is also supported by other passages in this text, see for instance 33 <foreign>tigaṅ vәṅi</foreign>; 38 <foreign>ro vәṅi</foreign>; 47 <foreign>pituṅ vәṅi</foreign>; etc.  </note> Its result is reaching the heaven of reverend Viṣṇu. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as one who is perfect in beauty, [as if coming] from Indra’s heaven, and wise. </p>
            <p n="28">There is the observance of not eating any tubers. It is called <foreign>avrәtibya</foreign>.<note>This word would appear to derive from the form of <foreign>vṛtti</foreign> declensed in the ablative or dative plural <foreign>(vṛttibhyaḥ</foreign>)<foreign>,</foreign>which however does not yield a contextually appropriate meaning here.</note> The reverend Viśeṣa visits the state of mind [of the practitioner]. It results in being good in behaviour, being in power without enemies<note>The word <foreign>kacakra</foreign> literally means ‘to throw a discus (at), hit with a discus’ (OJED). In this context, I freely translate as ‘being in power’, on account of the expression <foreign>tan śatru</foreign> ( ‘without enemies’) in the passage, and because the discus is a well-known symbol of royalty in the Indic world, often (but not always) associated with Viṣṇu—see e.g. the expression <foreign>cakravartin</foreign>or ‘universal emperor’.</note>, [and having] a book as a mark of ornament<note> I translate the phrase <foreign>pustaka lәṅәn</foreign> as ‘having a book as a mark of ornament’ in the light of a passage in <foreign>Kakavin Sumanaśantaka</foreign>: <foreign>rare saṅ Aja śakti pustaka lĕṅĕn Raghuvĕka vani kavy anuṅgali,</foreign> ‘Prince Aja was young yet mighty in books of poetry. He was the son of Raghu, courageous and an exceptional poet’ (56.4; Worsley et al, 2013: 220–221). Worsley et al. (<foreign>ibid</foreign>.: 484) give a note for the word <foreign>lәṅәn</foreign>, speculating that it may denote a person who had attained a certain rank amongst the court literati, that is, who had been awarded with a <foreign>lĕngĕn</foreign>, or mark of honour for exceptional skills in literature.</note>.</p>
            <p n="29">There is the observance of [eating] food (especially edible roots and fruits) [once] every month. Its appointed duration is one year. [Its result] is being successful in all of your works. You will be beautiful and famous.</p>
            <p n="30">There is the observance of fasting. Its appointed duration is seven nights. [Its result] is that whatever is desired is obtained, bravery, and being dear to the gods.</p>
            <p n="31">There is the observance of ‘acting like Kumbhakarṇa’ (<foreign>Ṅumbhakarṇa</foreign>): one sleeps continuously, [and] then fasts. Its appointed duration is three years. Its result is reaching the heaven of reverend Rudra. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a minister who is successful with the king.</p>
            <p n="31">There is the observance of sleeping in a leaning position. Its appointed duration is three years. Its result is to receive gifts, effective speech, and you will be loved among all mankind. </p>
            <p n="33">There is the observance of eating one handful of leaves held on the left hand, mixed with grilled coconut, without adding [anything] more throughout its duration. It is called being like a lotus (<foreign>Amadma</foreign>). The reverend Tampur I Rāt comes down to the one carrying out the observance. Its result is that the color of the fingers looks like the nails, then you will be loved by the people.</p>
            <p n="34">There is the observance of eating a rice cone (<foreign>tumpәṅ</foreign>) with any kind of pure meat<note>In the modern Balinese ritual context, the expression <foreign>ivak sarva śuci</foreign> also means any kind of pure meat, i.e., excluding pork.</note>. Its appointed duration is three nights. It is called having continuously in mind [the Lord] (<foreign>akiryasadā</foreign>). The deity is the reverend Iśvara. Its result is that [when someone] sings [his voice will be] pleasant to hear.</p>
            <p n="35">There is the observance of acting like a dog (<foreign>aṅasva</foreign>):<note>I have emended the word <foreign>anasva</foreign> in both ms. into <foreign>aṅasva</foreign>‘acting like a dog’ because I assume that the base word is <foreign>asu</foreign> ‘dog’ (OJED). This functions in the same way as the labels of others observances like <foreign>aṅumbhakarṇa</foreign> ‘acting like Kumbhakarṇa’ in this text. Another possibility for the name of this observance is  <foreign>aṅasū, inasū</foreign>‘to bind together’ (OJED).</note> one does not eat fragrant rice,<note>The word <foreign>iṅi</foreign>is not attested in OJED. Therefore, I emend it into <foreign>iṅiṅ</foreign>, meaning ‘fragrant’ or ‘diffusing fragrance’ (OJED). I speculate that this term may be related to the type of food given to dogs in ancient Java, namely, rice with salt rather than rice cooked with spices, which was reserved for human beings. Thus, to carry out this observance would amount to ‘eating dog’s food’.</note> but only rice with salt. Its appointed duration is one year and three months. The deity is the goddess Rājalakṣmī. Great is its accomplishment: you will be famous. </p>
            <p n="36">There is the observance of honey (<foreign>madhu</foreign>): one eats turmeric and charcoal; its rice [base] is a rice-cone. Its result is being young and smart.<note>I emend the word <foreign>maṇdha</foreign> in ms. A and <foreign>maṇdhu</foreign> in ms. B into <foreign>madhu</foreign> for two reasons. First, the phenomenon reflected in this passage, i.e.prenasalization (the addition of [a]n), is common in the transmission of Old Javanese texts (Acri 2017: 61): see also below, passage [40], <foreign>hadurmma</foreign>(ms. B) vis-à-vis <foreign>handhuṙmma</foreign>(ms. A). Second, the word <foreign>madhu</foreign>, which means ‘honey‘ (OJED), has the same colour, namely ‘yellow’, as the turmeric (<foreign>kunir</foreign>) mentioned in this passage.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="37">There is the observance of the charcoal earth (<foreign>Bhū Harәṅ</foreign>): when one eats a pinch of salt and charcoal first [before eating].<note>I translated the phrase <foreign>uyah arәṅ</foreign>as ‘salt and charcoal’, although there is no word like <foreign>mvaṅ</foreign>, <foreign>lan</foreign>, etc., between them. This is because the two ingredients are often paired. In the Balinese tradition, until now, a mix of salt and charcoal, also referred to as <foreign>uyah arәṅ,</foreign> is still widely used as a means of treating diseases, as well as in offerings (see KBIBL s.v. <foreign>uyah</foreign>).</note> Its appointed duration is three years. The deity is the goddess Saṅgī. It results in [being able to] hear all at once anything that happens in the world; you will be famous. </p>
            <p n="38">There is the observance of the sharpness (<foreign>landhәp</foreign>): when one eats a pinch of salt first [before eating]<note>The word <foreign>tandәp</foreign> does not exist in Old Javanese and Balinese, therefore, I emend it into <foreign>alaṇḍәp</foreign>, ‘sharp, pointed’, from <foreign>laṇḍĕp</foreign> II, ‘sharpness, pointedness’, because one bites the pinch of little salt with the pointed tip of the tongue. Alternatively, this expression may refer to the sharp taste of salt.</note>. The deity is the lord Viṣṇu. Its appointed duration is seven years. It results in being trusted when talking and being obeyed. Many [people] will be loving and compassionate [towards you], [and] the gods will be affectionate towards you.</p>
            <p n="39">There is the observance of going on the water (<foreign>añjalāntara</foreign>): one should not eat any cooked seeds, as well as fruits that are cooked with fire. One should commence it on each first half of the ninth month (<foreign>Kasaṅa</foreign>) and it should be performed for three months until the month of <foreign>Asadha</foreign>, plus two nights in the first month (<foreign>Kaśa</foreign>). Its appointed duration is three years. Its results are success, good character, wisdom, valour, and wealth in gold and silver, even though one attains liberation<note> The conjunction <foreign>yadyastun</foreign> means ‘even, even though; supposing that, if’ (OJED). Grammatically, this word indicates contrast between the main clause and the dependent clause. In this case, the word <foreign>yadyastun</foreign>seems to oppose the results of the observance, such as success, good character, wisdom, valour, and wealth in gold and silver’ with final liberation (<foreign>mokṣa</foreign>). It is possible that the author wanted to hint at the state of <foreign>Jīvanmukti</foreign>(‘liberated in life’), obtained by the practitioner—for instance, by means of yoga—on the top of the results of this specific observance: one can get worldly welfare while attaining liberation at the same time.</note>.</p>
            <p n="40">There is the observance of eating roots (<foreign>amulāhāra</foreign>)<note>The texts does not specify which part of the <foreign>palasara</foreign>tree should be eaten, and I have not found any information in this regard in related texts.</note>: one eats <foreign>palasara</foreign> (<foreign>Alyxia stellata</foreign>). The deity is the reverend Brahmā. Its result is reaching the heaven of the Lord Guru, the holy station of Śiva. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a powerful priest, wealthy in his rebirth.</p>
            <p n="41">There is the observance of smoking [food] (<foreign>adhūma</foreign>).<note>I have emended <foreign>hadurmma</foreign>in ms. B and <foreign>handhuṙmma</foreign>in ms. A in the light of a passage in a ms. of the <foreign>Panarima Brata</foreign>in the Pusdok collection, which reads: <foreign>hana brata, ndumā, ṅa, tan pamaṅan huṛyyaniṁ hapuy, phalanya, muliḥ riṁ svaṛggan bhaṭāra Iśvarā, mañjanma riṁ kula putra riṁ dlahā</foreign>(folio 23 r line 4-23 v line-1), ‘there is the observance of smoking [food], which means, not to eat [food that] has been left over from (i.e., cooked on) fire. Its fruit is to go to the heaven of the Lord Īśvara’. My emendation reflect the semantic similarity between the adjectival/verbal forms <foreign>adhūma</foreign>and <foreign>nduma,</foreign> both deriving from <foreign>dhūma</foreign> in Old Javanese, meaning ‘1: <foreign>dhūma</foreign> (Skt smoke, vapour) smoke; smoking, smoky. See also <foreign>nir-</foreign>. <foreign>madhūma</foreign>with smoke’ (OJED).</note> Its result is reaching the heaven of the reverend Iśvara. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a son of a noble family.</p>
            <p n="42">There is the observance of raw food (<foreign>alavar</foreign>)<note> There is no explanation about the specific technique and the appointed duration for performing the <foreign>Brata Ṅlavar</foreign>in this passage. However, the word <foreign>lavar</foreign>itself means ‘uncooked, raw (= <foreign>añaṅ</foreign>)’ (OJED). The <foreign>Panarima Brata</foreign>(ms. Pusat Dokumentasi Kebudayaan Bali 23 v line 3-4) contains more details about the technique to perform the observance, as follows:  <foreign>hana bratā ṅlavaṛ, ṅa, tan pamaṅan huyaḥ, pat ulan pәtaṁ vәṅi samayanya, bhaṭāra saṅkāra hyaṁnya, phalanyā, ----------, sasaṛnya mañjanmā listuhayu paripūrṇna</foreign> ‘there is the observance of raw food (<foreign>alavar</foreign>): one does not eat salt; its appointed duration is four months and four nights. The deity is the reverend Śaṅkara. Its result is <foreign>….</foreign> [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is to be reborn as a beautiful [person].’ </note>. The deity is reverend Śaṅkara. Its result is to be reborn as a beautiful [person]; you will be smart. </p>
            <p n="43">There is the observance of eating the tendril of <foreign>campaka</foreign> (<foreign>Magnolia campaka</foreign>) up to its bud.<note> There is no preposition <foreign>ri</foreign> between the phrase <foreign>anәrus</foreign> and <foreign>pucuke</foreign> in this sentence. This is probably attributable to the style of the author. Compare the occurrences listed in OJED (s.v. <foreign>anrus</foreign>, <foreign>tumrus</foreign>) drawn from comparatively late Old Javanese sources: Koravāśrama 52.1 (<foreign>manrus panon</foreign>) and <foreign>Raṅga Lave</foreign>3.11 (<foreign>waṅinyânrus nagari</foreign>), 12.5 (<foreign>mrik sumar anrus nagar</foreign>a). Compare below, note 237.</note>  The deity is the reverend Śambhu. Its result is reaching the heaven of the Lord Guru or the Lord Śiva.<note> The appointed duration of this observance is not indicated in this passage, either because of a textual corruption or an authorial glitch.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="44">There is the observance of drinking the water at<note> There is no preposition <foreign>ri</foreign> between <foreign>jala</foreign> and <foreign>pucuk</foreign> in this sentence.

It results in being a successful minister, having an iron-body,<note> See my note to the same expression <foreign>bajrakaya</foreign>occurring in par. 23.</note> and winning over enemies.</p>
            <p n="45">There is the observance of not drinking water while eating, [provided] it does not cause one to have difficulty in swallowing<note> The word <foreign>kasәrәtan</foreign> literally means ‘hesitant, undecided? stammering?’ (OJED). In the context of eating, I prefer to translate it more freely as ‘difficulty in swallowing.’</note>. Its result is that anything that you desire and [any of your] efforts will be obtained quickly. Its appointed duration is seven years. </p>
            <p n="46">There is the observance of contented life (<foreign>lәgapraṇa</foreign>)<note>The word <foreign>lәga</foreign> literally means ‘open, satisfied, content, relieved; taking lightly, accepting, renouncing readily’ (OJED), while the word <foreign>prāṇa</foreign> means ‘the breath of life, life’ (OJED), hence my literal translation. Alternative translations of this expression could be ‘renouncing life readily’, and ‘easy breathing’.</note>: if one eats having a kris at the side. Its appointed duration is one year and seven months. The deity is the reverend Rudra. It results in many people being ready to sacrifice their lives [for the person]; many people will be compassionate towards [him].</p>
            <p n="47">There is the observance to follow the moon. On the first day after the waxing moon, you should obtain only a handful to eat. It should be performed by adding [a handful every] day on the waxing period of the moon until the full moon day. During the [following] fourteen waning lunar days, reduce your handful [of food] until the dark moon. Its appointed duration is three months. The deity is the reverend Indra. Its results are being clever and having right judgement; anything you do will be successful, and you will be skillful in playing gamelan and singing.</p>
            <p n="48">There is the observance of intention (<foreign>keta</foreign>): one eats a handful of food in one day. Its appointed duration is seven nights. Its result is that [all] efforts reach their goal.</p>
            <p n="49">There is the observance of ‘acting like the Pāṇḍavas’ (<foreign>amandava</foreign>): one should obtain five handfuls of food in one day [to eat]. Its appointed duration is five months. Its result is that you will gain good qualities and a perfect kind disposition [towards others].</p>
            <p n="50">There is the observance of eating seven handfuls [of food] in one day. Its appointed duration is four months. Its result is that you will flourish. </p>
            <p n="51">There is the observance of not touching oil. Its appointed duration is three months. It results in being perfectly beautiful, wise, and loved by society. </p>
            <p n="52">There is the observance of not chewing betel leaves. Its appointed duration is one year. Its result is that the shape of one’s face is <foreign>mebər</foreign> (?)<note>Literally, the word <foreign>mebәr</foreign> means ‘to fly’ (OJED). In Balinese the word <foreign>ibәr</foreign>, <foreign>ṅibәr</foreign> not only means ‘to fly’ but also ‘spinning around’ (KBIBL). Since the word following <foreign>mebәr</foreign> is <foreign>rūpa</foreign> ‘1. outward appearance or colour, form, shape, figure’ (OJED), one would expect a word related to the appearance or shape of a person’s face. While I am not confident to integrate this suggestion into my translation, I tentatively point out that, on account of the Balinese meaning ‘spinning around’, one could imagine that the word is related to the round shape of the face, which is associated with beauty.</note>; many [people will] love you.</p>
            <p n="53">There is the observance of the twelfth month (<foreign>sada</foreign>)<note>
                  <foreign>Sada</foreign> (<foreign>āṣādha</foreign>) could have three meanings: 1. (<foreign>sadā</foreign>I) ‘(Skt) always, every time, continually, regularly’; 2. ‘II. a month of the lunar calendar, roughly coinciding with <foreign>hapit</foreign>II (June-July)’; 3. ‘III. somewhat, a little’ (OJED). While any of these three meanings could be appropriate here, I propend for 2., indicating the months during which this observance should be performed.</note>: if one drinks flower-infused water first before eating. Its appointed duration is three years. The deity is the reverend Asmara. Its result is that many people desire you.</p>
            <p n="54">There is the observance of behaving like a <foreign>vidu</foreign> (<foreign>mavidu</foreign>)<note>I have emended the word <foreign>mvida</foreign> in both ms. into <foreign>mavidu</foreign>because there may have been a drop of the subscript <foreign>u</foreign>in both mss., and also of the prefix <foreign>ma</foreign>-, perhaps as a result of oral expression, resulting in the cluster <foreign>mv</foreign>-. Furthermore, there appears to be a connection between the form <foreign>mavidu</foreign> and the explanation of this observance: a <foreign>vidu</foreign>is a homeless/itinerant character and, at the same time, an actor and a Śaiva religious practitioner, who is made fun of in the <foreign>Kakavin Rāmāyaṇa</foreign>. In chapters 24.111–115 and 25.19–22 the <foreign>vidu</foreign>is criticized for being a homelessness wandering performer (see Acri 2011); in this case, the character is probably regarded as begging for food from other people, which means that they did not eat hot rice because they did not have a kitchen.</note>: not eating hot rice. Its appointed duration is seven years. Its result is that many people will love you. </p>
            <p n="56">There is the observance of the council (<foreign>sabha</foreign>): on the twelfth waxing lunar day of the seventh month (Kapitu), one stays awake. Its results are having an iron body,<note>See my note to the same expression <foreign>bajrakaya</foreign>occurring in par. 23. brata] A; bra(ta) B</note> winning over enemies, being trusted by society, smart [and] skillful in playing gamelan and singing, and having a lot of gold and silver, and many cows and buffalos indeed. Its method is that at midnight, you have to stand up on one foot, without sleeping; you [will gain] magical powers and supernatural faculties.</p>
            <p n="56">There is the observance of observing the five silences (<foreign>amañcamona</foreign>). It consists of not talking while eating, not talking while sweeping, not talking while applying ashes [on one’s body/forehead], not talking while chewing betel, and not talking while defecating. </p>
            <p n="55.1">The observance of not talking while eating,<note> I suspect there is a missing portion of text, i.e. the first observance in the list of five, namely <foreign>mona maṅan</foreign>, which I have conjecturally restored in the edition. In this way, the results of the five subtypes of observances are consistently described in their respective sub-paragraphs.</note> It results in being desired<note>The word <foreign>kinuptiṅan</foreign>is not attested in OJED. I offer two possible interpretations for this word: 1. <foreign>kinutptiyan</foreign>, which means ‘benefited’ or 2. <foreign>kinaptyan</foreign>, which means ‘desired’.</note> [by the people], being brave, having many disciples, and having a long life. Its appointed duration is three years. The deity is the reverend Rudra.</p>
            <p n="56">The result of not talking while sweeping is that one is dear to the priests [and] the king loves [him], [and] is beautiful.</p>
            <p n="57">The result of being silent when applying the holy ash (<foreign>bhasma</foreign>) is that one reaches the heaven of the Lord Guru. [Alternatively, if] something goes wrong, one is reborn as a priest who has many disciples.</p>
            <p n="58">The result of not talking when chewing betel is that one becomes beautiful and smart, skillful in playing gamelan and singing, and is quickly reborn [as human].<note> The meaning of the word <foreign>moghaṅti</foreign>is not clear here. The word <foreign>mogha</foreign> is usually written <foreign>mogha</foreign>, <foreign>amogha</foreign>: ‘a connection with Skt is, however, unlikely; It suddenly came to pass; it came about that, and hence it happened (indicating a consequence)’ (OJED). However, the function and meaning of the <foreign>ṅti</foreign>are not clear here. Therefore, I emended the word <foreign>moghaṅti</foreign>into <foreign>moghāṅjanma</foreign>, which means ‘quickly reborn [as human]’. Another possibility is  <foreign>moghāṅganti janma</foreign>which has a similar meaning, i.e.‘quickly change incarnation’.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="59">The result of being silent when defecating is that one becomes wise and is successful in any effort.</p>
            <p>The preparation when one is to perform an observance  is the following: one should take a bath,<note> I have emended the word <foreign>hadyus</foreign> in ms. A and <foreign>jadyus</foreign> in ms. B into <foreign>adyusa</foreign>, so as to make it morphologically consistent with other forms in this passage, such as <foreign>akuramasa</foreign>, <foreign>aśucya</foreign>, <foreign>asisiga</foreign>, and <foreign>aririhana,</foreign> in the context of preparatory practices that should be done before carrying out the observances.</note> wash one’s hair, purify oneself, and comb one’s hair. This is the reverend <foreign>Tattva Brata</foreign> (Treatise on Observances). Do not reveal its observances indiscriminately to others. This is a truly esoteric teaching. Thus ends the <foreign>Tattva Brata</foreign>, finished to be composed at the feet of the reverend [Mount] Pamrihan, on the southeastern slope, on Saturday <foreign>Paing</foreign> of Varigaguṅ (<foreign>Varagadean</foreign>) week<note>I interpret the string <foreign>vuku</foreign>, <foreign>mara</foreign>
                  <foreign>aguṅ</foreign> as <foreign>vuku Varigaguṅ</foreign> or <foreign>Varagadean</foreign>, two forms that are attested in Modern Javanese (see sastra.org, s.v. … ) with the meaning of ‘8th  <foreign>vuku</foreign>’. The word <foreign>mara</foreign> is quite similar to <foreign>vara,</foreign> while <foreign>aguṅ</foreign> ‘largeness, bigness, strength’ (OJED) has the same meaning of <foreign>gәde</foreign> ‘largeness, bigness’ (OJED). Another possible interpretation of  <foreign>vuku, mara</foreign>, <foreign>aguṅ</foreign>is <foreign>vuku</foreign>, <foreign>Marakih</foreign>, on account of the fact that the word ‘<foreign>Marakih</foreign>’ is attested in OJED as the name of the 16th <foreign>vuku,</foreign> so it may be analysed as the cognate form <foreign>Marākeh</foreign>, i.e. <foreign>mara</foreign>+ <foreign>akeh</foreign>’, in which <foreign>kveh</foreign> or <foreign>akeh</foreign> ‘number, amount, great number’(OJED) has a meaning that is similar to <foreign>aguṅ</foreign>‘largeness, bigness, strength’ (OJED). This method of writing chronograms with synonyms or <foreign>dasanama</foreign>is a common practice among writers in the archipelago. One of the objectives is to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the text and of the writer or copyist.</note>, Dhaṅu.</p>
