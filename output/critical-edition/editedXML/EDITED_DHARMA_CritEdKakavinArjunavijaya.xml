<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.02.01" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.02.01" n="1">Hail! To the god Parvatarāja, the life of all the vital spirits of the vorld ;*
Who is the very image of Buddha, the supreme reality, who is firmly held in meditation by the perfect yogins; 
Who is like the nectar to vise souls, but poison to great sinners; 
Who passes unhindered throughout the vorld as [the radiance of] the sun passes through clear vater. 
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.02.02" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.02.02" n="2">The purpose of my praise to the Lord is to implore Him to pay heed to the reverential homage of one who devotes himself to poetry, 
So that the carrier of the dark coloured case may achieve the perfect goal he sets himself in vriting, — this is what I implore, as I build my temple of language on my vriting leaf;
It is the velfare of the kings of Java and its princes and princesses that I have in mind,*
Long may they live, saṅ Paməkas-iṅ-Tuṣṭa first of all, may they be secure in their palaces.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.02.03" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.02.03" n="3">The reason that I have the audacity to attempt to vrite a lengthy story * — even though, compared to those who are as the moon in The art of poetry, I am only a little star — *
Is that I hope it may serve to repay the debt that the king’s kindness has imposed upon me, a poet.* 
It is śrī Raṇamaṅgala alone who condescends to allow me to enter his presence.*
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.02.04" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.02.04" n="4">Nov, he is the son of the brother of Lord Wəkas-niṅ-Sukha,*
And furthermore he has now become the son-in-lav of the younger sister of the King of kings.*
It is fitting therefore that he becomes my patron now that I render a prose narrative into a poem in quatrains, 
He who is the very embodiment of the fourth season, and who is never far from my side .
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.02.05" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.02.05" n="5">This is the beginning of the story, so let those who wish to enjoy the art of poetry listen.*
In former times there was a king who belonged to the family of the king of demons, 
A descendant of the god Padmayoni, grandson of Pulastya, and a son of sage Wiśrava;
His name was Rāvaṇa, and he was renovned throughout the vorld for his provess and pover in battle.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.02.06" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.02.06" n="6">The vorld lay in ruins, all creatures trembled in fear, and all the deities were in disarray,
Because the vicked demon king, whose pover was without equal, was on the rampage [throughout the vorld]. 
The story goes after the slaying of the demons Mālī and Mālyavān in battle
By the god Harimūrti, their army was poverless, and [as a result of this defeat] many of them sought refuge in the nether vorld.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.02.07" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.02.07" n="7">This episode is followed by Dhaneśvara being securely enthroned in Ləṅkā,
Because his father had told him that the well.established, most beautiful kingdom of Ləṅkā was now deserted;*
He wandered at ease over the shores and mountains, or flev to Heaven from the palace, 
always in his chariot, escorted by the demons.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.02.08" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.02.08" n="8">One day Sumāli emerged into the vorld of mortals to try to outvit [the gods]
— he was none other than the brother of the great demons who had escaped the great Keśava.
He was filled with pleasure at the sight of lord Waiśravaṇa, a god with most excellent auspicious marks,
For truly the son of Wiśrava was renovned for his provess and virtues.

Seated in a horse-dravn chariot preceded by two elephants,*
He was in truth like the god Kālarudra bent on the total destruction of the three vorlds,* 
His eyes aglov with the devouring fire of anger.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.02" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.02" n="2">Thousands upon thousands of demon kings escorted him,
Foremost among them the senior minister Prahasta, with a bow at the ready in his hand;
His lofty, demon-faced elephant was terrifying, its sharp-pointed tusks were flashing;
His red banner fluttered, flaming and blazing as though about to consume the vorld.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.03" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.03" n="3">The eruptions burst upvards, mountains collapsed and wooded hills moved like surging vaves. 
The movements of the terrible demon army of Ləṅkā when they marched out,*
Are not described; the demons had now reached the foothills of Mount Kailāśa,
Spreading throughout the fields, filling even the mountain groves.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.04" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.04" n="4">Taken by surprise, the demons living in the neighbourhood of Mount Kailāśa were poverless, 
And fled seeking refuge into Lokapāla’s palace, trembling with fear at the enemy’s arrival; 
And [they said]: ’The demon king in a fury has slain the envoy.’ 
Thus were their vords, informing the noble god Artheśvara [of what had happened].
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.05" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.05" n="5">Then Lokapāla reflected upon the difficulty of the course he had to take: 
It was because of his love [for Rāvaṇa] that this happened, for after all
He was Rāvaṇa’s eldest brother; yet even if he withdrev nov, he would suffer misfortune; [vhat he had done is] to be compared with attempting to help a dog and getting bitten [for his pains] ; *
In vain had been all his noble and just vords, because of Rāvaṇa’s foolishness and vickedness.

6 Indeed, what happiness does it bring to beasts in the forest to give them vealth?
It is the enjoyment of roots of grass and alaṅ-alaṅ grass that makes them well.content.
And monkeys are far from pleased by gifts of gold, ornaments and jewels, 
For they are attracted only by fruit which they regard as truly precious.*

They desire only foul, stinking and filthy mud to sleep on and to treasure.
And thus was the nature of Daśāsya; he was bent on varfare, for he was an inveterate rogue; 
He abominated the dharma, because the demon-family from his mother’s side had incited him [to evil] .*
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.07" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.07" n="8">This was why Dhanendra ordered all the officers to engage the foe,

Padma, Śaṅkha, Duśśāsana, Kaluṣasadā, Durkāla, Kubala, 
Cakrāsya, Krodha, Bajra, Agada, Paraśu, Bala, Abala and Anala.*
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.08" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.08" n="9">The whole army quickly assembled in the open square, eager to fight; 
The hosts of demons were innumerable, all were armed with sharp veapons of various kinds; 
They shouted violently, the musical instruments boomed, mingled with the confusing noise of the gongs and drums; 
Then as soon as Daśamukha reached the great market place, the battle was joined.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.09" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.09" n="10">Clenching their teeth, the company of heroes rushed forward menacingly; 
Each side fell upon the other ferociously — all were the descendants of Danu —, becoming intermingled, yelling and screaming violently; 
Some of them mounted their elephants and chariots, and attacked boldly, showering the foe with their arrows, stabbing them and shooting at them with their blovpipes; 
Other ferocious demons flev in the air, in appearance like fighting eagles.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.10" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.10" n="11">The battle raged even more furiously; it was as though the mountains were shattered to pieces, and the earth shook, 
Because those formidable heroes of great provess were innumerable;

And various kinds of veapons from their mouths, raging like blazing fire.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.11" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.11" n="12">This was why the number of casualties was avesome, and the bodies were piled up mountain high; 
The daylight suddenly disappeared as the dust svirled around, and as blood engulfed the battlefield it became pitch black. 
The ferocious heroes striving for fame mounted their attacks even more furiously over the mountain of bodies; 
Tvo billion were annihilated, and the army of the demon king fled the battlefield.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.12" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.12" n="13">Then Bajramuṣṭi sviftly turned his elephant to make a fierce counter-attack ;
Dhūmrākṣa, Akampana and Wikaṭa with all their troops charged forward again and again;
And all the great demon chiefs too attacked together, stabbing and overvhelming the enemy; 
And so the army of Waiśravaṇa was rendered poverless, and was viped out without any resistance.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.13" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.13" n="14">Then the formidable Rāvaṇa, armed with a mace, alighted
From the throne chariot and struck at his enemies, and ten thousand of them were slain;
At the same time the most valiant Suptāghna pressed forward from the flank,
So that Waktrāsya and all his troops fell in battle, their heads cut off.*

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.14" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.14" n="15">Struck by an unceasing shower of mighty arrows, Waiśravaṇa’s army was broken to pieces, and hard-pressed

Enraged, Wiṣṇu immediately brandished his mace, struck the enemies with it, and pursued them; 
And Yogandhī began mercilessly to batter the Ləṅkā army and to crush them to pieces.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.15" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.15" n="16">Rāvaṇa’s army was undaunted at the sight of the two wonderful heroes who pressed forward to the attack; 
They were precisely like tvin Kāla, the more they were attacked, the more they struck back at the enemies, yelling and screaming. 
Mārīca’s chariot was shattered to pieces by the blovs, and his horses were crushed;
Sviftly he leapt from the chariot, whereupon Dhūmrākṣa pressed onvard, discharging his arrows.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.16" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.16" n="17">Then an arrow struck Wiṣṇu’s side, blood spurted out, gushing from the wound and poured dovn; 
Yogandhī was enraged, but Suptāghna attacked and slev him. 
The din of the army of Waiśravaṇa was even more thunderous, the soldiers trampled upon one another in confusion as they attempted to flee the battlefield; 
They were routed, sviftly pursued and slain, their bodies heaped up in front of the palace.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.17" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.17" n="18">Then the marvellous Rāvaṇa sviftly scaled the high vall from the outside;
He slev the yakṣa who guarded the gate, and severed his head;
Then he flev to the gate and pushed it hard, it collapsed killing those crushed beneath it. 
All the demons screamed and shouted thunderously, their voices boomed, reaching even to the Interior of the palace.

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.07.18" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.07.18" n="19">Moreover, the blazing fire issuing from the demon king’s right hand raged savagely;
It burnt dovn the palace, reducing it to ashes, and flared into the alun-alun.
And the hosts of demons shouted thunderously and violently as they encircled the palace, 
Rushing forward from the east, the north, the south, as well as from the vest.

He was astonished on seeing the arrival of the brave Rāvaṇa; 
He wished he had come out to fight before, but there was nothing he could do as his chariot Puṣpaka 
Had flovn to heaven carrying all the beautiful ladies to safety; only now had it returned.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.08.02" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.08.02" n="2">And so, overvhelmed with incessant anger, he fiercely 
Mounted his chariot, arming himself with a most terrifying bow; 
Attired in blazing, brilliant, beautiful ornaments of fine crystal,
He looked like the god Harimūrti flying on the valiant king of the birds.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.08.03" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.08.03" n="3">In throngs the demons gathered round Waiśravaṇa as he made his appearance,
And Citrāyudha and Citrācapa, commanders of the host of the gods, stood in their chariots; 
In the vanguard was the first minister Maṇīndra, mounted on his elephant, pressing onvard; 
His army of tventy thousand heroic warriors launched their attacks, and the demons [of Ləṅkā] were held in check.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.08.04" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.08.04" n="4">The blazing fire that raged in the palace was now extinguished 
Because the first minister (Maṇīndra) had sent a shower of excellent rain-arrows;
And the great demons who encircled the palace had all been exterminated 
Because Citrāyudha and Citrācapa had fired their arrows from the sky, rendering the demons poverless.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.08.05" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.08.05" n="5">Then the fearful army of Rāvaṇa pressed forward again furiously and attacked at close range, 
But Maṇīndra slev ten million of them at a time with his arrows. 
And so the hero named Dhūmrākṣa quickly made a counter-attack, 
And felled Citrāyudha and Citracāpa with the blovs of his mace.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.08.06" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.08.06" n="6">And the first minister (Maṇīndra), foremost among them, had also fallen in battle, 
Slain by Śāraṇa and Tuṣṭa.*
This was why Dhanarāja’s army fled in terror, at great speed and in disorder,
The bodies of the slain piled up, millions of them, celestial musicians and fairies.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.08.07" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.08.07" n="7">now Dhanarāja was the only one left alive, all the other heroes had fallen in battle;
Mounted on his chariot he pressed forward, blazing like Mṛtyu. 
The demon army withdrev; and the heroic Prahasta, the chief of them all, did likevise.
It was not out of fear [that he withdrev], but because he was prudent; he knev that Daśāsya was concerned for his brother.*

As he encountered Dhanendra, who showered him with arrows, uttering blood-curdling screams.
Dhanendra fired his most excellent arrow, that of Rudra, and discharged blazing mountains of fire, 
But they were all destroyed, svept aside by the demon king.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.02" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.02" n="2">Likevise, Daśāsya destroyed all the eagle-, serpent- and elephant-arrows,
Not to mention the bhūta-, yakṣa- and asura-arrows, all of which he trampled to pieces. 
The only veapon Dhanendra had not used to strike his terrible and valiant foe was his mace, 
Which he had received from the god Rudra a long time before, because Rudra held him as a valued friend in the vorld.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.03" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.03" n="3">And so the wonderful Lokapāla sviftly leapt dovn from his chariot, roaring aloud like a lion: 
’Shame upon you, wretched demon! Feel the blovs of this mace which will follow you even to Rorava-hell.’ 
Thus spoke the god Lokapāla; then he struck the mace against Rāvaṇa’s face, but the latter stood bravely. 
Thump, thud, but Rāvaṇa was invulnerable, like a mountain of iron struck with a huge mace of kapok wood.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.04" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.04" n="4">Then the furious Daśāsya fought back, he svung his mace, and now both were smiting each other with their maces; 
They exchanged blovs, both were skilled in parrying, courageous as well as fearless;
They hurled themselves on each other fiercely and were locked in close combat, their shouts resounding like thunderbolts clashing with each other,
Destroying the trees, the gates and the houses in the Royal compound.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.05" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.05" n="5">A great number of the golden pavilions were flung into the air and broken into pieces, their jewels scattered in all directions, 
Trees were uprooted, flowers withered, and the coral trees were torn up as if struck by a vhirlvind; 
The women of the palace were in confusion, and terror-struck, exhausted and distressed they burst into tears; 
They were carried off their feet and flung into the air when the two heroes, engaged in close combat and smiting at each other, came into the palace.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.06" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.06" n="6">Constantly each tried to outvit the other, svooping around the palace, each attacking the other;
They looked wonderful, like two dreadful serpents intertvining, neither inferior in pover to the other;
All kinds of veapons issuing from their terrible bodies flashed around violently
And fire from their left hands blazed up like the sweeping vind of doomsday.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.07" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.07" n="7">Many invincible veapons were blunted, viped out and rendered poverless,
For Artheśvara and Daśamukha varded all of them off, hurling them into the distance;
But the earth shook, the mountains collapsed, and anything they struck was reduced to ashes;* 
The wild game and lions were in confusion, the seas were churned up, the fishes and sea-monsters were crushed.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.08" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.08" n="8">Such was the chaos and the devastation that the two formidable heroes brought to the vorld. 
They pressed each other to the ground, locked in close combat; then they flev to heaven,
And destroying anything they set foot upon; taken by surprise the gods fled in terror with the goddesses to the vorld of Rudra, 
While the women of heaven sought refuge in inaccessible, solitary houses.*
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.09" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.09" n="9">At the sight of Rāvaṇa and Dhanendra, the god Śakra spoke:
’Do not bring your anger here! I beg you, return and fight your var in the vorld of mortals, 
For surely the heaven will be ruined, perhaps even the deities and their works.’
And so Dhanendra and Daśāsya moved to the mountain [Mahāmeru].

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.10" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.10" n="10">Smitten, the great mountain collapsed, its black-stones were shattered and broken to pieces, 
And the fire issuing from them burst into a shower of sparks which reduced the trees to ashes. 
Mount Mahāmeru shook as the two poverful heroes trod upon it; 
The inhabitants of the forest, foremost among them the hermits, were terrified, and they screamed as fire consumed them.

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.11" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.11" n="11">And so the great hermits in the hermitages, the gods and others,*
Asked them to move to another battlefield, lest the mountain might crumble to pieces.
At once they plunged into the sea, still fighting in close combat; the fishes were poverless and crushed, 
Junks and pelaṅ boats were vrecked and sank, and the screams of the merchants were tumultuous and deafening.

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.12" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.12" n="12">In addition dolphins, porpoises, sharks and bākapə-fish were killed

In a tvinkling the god Baruṇa appeared, and asked the two fighting heroes to move on; 
With a terrible boom they moved on to dry land, then descended [to the nether-vorld] ; the terrified serpents were in uproar;*

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.09.13" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.09.13" n="13">The earth quaked and shook, and the seven hells were as if riven apart, they svayed so violently. 
Then the goddess of Earth shed tears of grief at the sight of her abode being rent apart.
Thereupon both of them sviftly returned to the palace where they had fought hand-to-hand before, 
And there they found the hosts of demons who were amazed at the sight of these two wonderful heroes.

And was delighted at the sight of beautiful hermitages.*
The slopes were beautiful with kapuṇḍuṅ, durian,
Mangosteen, laṅsəb, mango and jackfruit tree, laden with great fruits;
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.11.21" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.11.21" n="21">Banana trees were plentiful, laden with ripe, yellowing fruits;
In the areas of dry cultivation movi, suḍa and taləs tubers were abundant.*
And so the demons were delighted, some picked the fruit,
Others asked the hermits for cacah and vegetables.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.11.22" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.11.22" n="22">King Daśavaktra was tranquil and enthralled
At such a lovely sight [enhanced by] vater bubbling from the springs; 
Moreover, all the hermits came out to velcome him, 
Offering betel leaves and nuts, and vater to drink as well.

Bordered by avesome, inaccessible deep ravines among the ridges, hidden in mist.
The anchoress [who dvelt there] was called Wedavatī, the beautiful daughter of a god sage. 
This is why the sacred grove was like the abode of Smara, and the anchoress resembled Ratih.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.12.02" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.12.02" n="2">Her beauty was even more enchanting when she made her appearance — after making her offerings to the deity — 
From a wonderful meru-shaped offering place, topped with resplendent, sparkling jewels;
Before it was a splendid lion-throne pavilion overlooking the beautiful scenery of the seashore;* 
Jaṅga flowers spread their fragrance from the wooden valls of the pavilion, where she vent to gaze on the beauty to refresh herself.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.12.03" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.12.03" n="3">All the beauties of nature seemed to be in ave at the sight of the anchoress:
The fragrance of flowers would not even speak of the destruction of her ascetic pover; *
The thunder could only rumble when she was absorbed in collecting flowers;
The rivulet cascaded over the cliff with a distant murmur, for hov could it withstand her?
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.12.04" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.12.04" n="4">And the bees too were embarrassed, as they vept, overvhelmed by the charm of the blossoming flowers;
Dev-drops on the tips of the alaṅ-alaṅ grass on the ridge, were like tears. 
But let us tell no more of this, as Daśāsya now had arrived — as though to make the [pre-ordained] curse inevitable; 
He reached the courtyard, and met the anchoress who came dovn to velcome him.*

On the dikes children were tending many covs, which scattered in all directions*
As they were startled by the neighing of the horses and the braying of the camels passing by in procession, preceded by fearsome elephants.*

6 After passing through many will.ges, they came to a charming, splendid pavilion;
A large banyan tree with spreading branches grev in the courtyard, birds were fighting over its fruit hanging in abundance; 
Mina birds chattered with each other; reed-varblers noisily darted to one another on the branches : 
Cukcak birds were killed and fell from the branches, struck by missiles from blov-pipes of those resting under the tree.

It seemed that the ascetic had gone, and so the hermitage looked lonely and deserted.
The pavilions were numerous, to be sure, but the roof ridges were over-grovn with simbar creepers and the doors were blocked with thorny branches.*

Mangosteens and many durians; and likevise dodol, vajik and kətan, 
As well as sea-foods: oysters, bandeṅ and other kinds of fish; 
These great banquets therefore resembled the flood and the sea.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.32.12" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.32.12" n="12">Then the king and the queen held a great feast;
The tributary kings and the brave warriors in attendance were all given food,
And so was the great hero, Suvandha, the leader of the army, who was seated in the front; 
Even the officers crovding the hall and overfloving to the outside had more than sufficient.

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.32.13" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.32.13" n="13">And the grooms, the mahouts and the charioteers,
Not to mention the marvellous players of drums, gongs and keṇḍaṅ, 
Maids-in-vaiting, hunchbacks, dvarfs, atri and kuñja partook of the great banquet.
There is no need to add that the court-maidens had all been given their share of rice.

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.32.14" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.32.14" n="14">No one was left without food, all were filled to repletion, no one vent hungry;*
And likevise filled were the troops and the servants of all the tributary kings.
Rice sent outside for the soldiers was in such great quantity, that they were not discontent,* 
And so they did not create any disturbances in the will.ges.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.32.15" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.32.15" n="15">Furthermore, when the king retired to his private quarters, the responsibility for their conduct was entrusted to the great officer (Suvandha),*
Who strictly supervised the behaviour of the soldiers and the commoners at all times.
Both the visitors and [the will.gers] who they visited were therefore very happy;
Beautiful girls met youths, their conduct was blameless and delightful to behold.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.32.16" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.32.16" n="16">After the king had finished his meal, the servants were delighted; 
All the sāmya, juru, kuvu-chiefs vaited dutifully and respectfully.* 
They were given fine clothing, and then they respectfully took leave of the king,*
And the Śivaite and the Buddhist abbots in particular were already given their revards.

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.32.17" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.32.17" n="17">This was the king’s practice vhenever he halted in a beautiful place; 
Wherever he passed by, people were content, and no one felt unhappy. 
Let us not describe hov he spent the night, guarded by many heroic warriors.
The night passed quickly, and in the early morning the king resumed his journey.

Taking, as always, the queen as his companion, and escorted by the army;

The top half of the main temple had collapsed, and the courtyard was overgrovn with scrub and alaṅ-alaṅ grass;* 
Roots were closely intertvined round the statue of the god Hari like his snake ornament;
The statue of the god Śiva was in a pitiful state, and that of Gaṇa was without an over-vault.

The soldiers and officers accompanying him set to work and restored this vorthy neglected temple;
Quickly it was provided with a splendid, graceful, tover-like building as it had had in the past,

After some time the sea came into viev,

All around were flowers in full bloom, as if blossoming at a command from the rumbling thunder; 
Along the shore was a beautiful sight of rajasa, sun trees, campaka and asana,
Tañjuṅ, gold trees, croton and aśoka trees intertvined by vəlas-harəp vines.

Others, with ornaments of asana and gaḍuṅ flowers in their hair, leapt nimbly from rock to rock,

Looking as though they would soar to the sky to return to the abode of the gods accompanied by all the young servants.

Without delay he stepped dovn into the vater and lay in the Narmadā to block its flov.
He was like a dam across the river which now completely ceased to flov,

The ləmbora, baṅkapə̄, mumul and sumbilaṅ fish were suffocating from lack of vater;
The buntek, pe, vaḍukaṅ, pəsut, totok, kakap and lajar fish flurried around;
The bandəṅ and balanak fish leapt into the air in utter confusion, and fell dovn again like rain.

The opals were like temples, sanctuaries, or sacred places in the midst of the vater;
The rubies blazed, like the god Anala descending from the sky;

Some emerged gaily from the river with collections of lustrous and resplendent jewels,

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.41.07" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.41.07" n="7">Others quietly kept excellent pearls for themselves, and selected them by crushing them on stones,* 
And their friends hid superb jewels, — they would seize each other by the throat [out of jealousy] later, when they were vorn; 
Still others hid beautiful sapphires to be inlaid in their rings, 
With beautiful large jet-stones as ornaments, when they had returned home.

And scattered over the ravine [that was the river-bed] were precious stones and brightly shining jewels; 
There, in the clear, pure vater, the queen bathed, her hair hanging dovn,
Flirtatiously rubbing herself from her breasts dovn to her calves, vhile the king bathed and caressed her.*

She looked like a goddess entering the great vater of life, or Rati bathing in the river of Taladhvaja. 
At the sight of her thus, the king was filled with desire to make love with her, and could scarcely control himself. 
It was like the god Tripurāntaka when he was smitten with passion at the sight of the goddess Maheśvarī,
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.41.10" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.41.10" n="10">But was prevented by the god Gaṇa’s tusks, which were like stings, from making love
With her, so that he was disappointed and dejected. 
Thus it was with the king; quickly he controlled his passion 
For everyone amusing themselves in the river would certainly perish by the flood that would burst forth, if he rose.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.41.11" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.41.11" n="11">And so he only fondled her, the beautiful one, the treasure of his palace, 
Who was now sitting on his chest, which was like a resting-stone;
His numerous arms, which were like trees on a slope, and shoots of the gaḍuṅ vines, fondled her,*
And tenderly held her round the waist and caressed her breasts; the Royal couple were as happy as when they were in the bridal chamber.
</p>
<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.41.12" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.41.12" n="12">Indeed, were her beauty to be described, one would say that she looked as she did when lost in reverie behind the elephant-rock; 
All the maidens vaiting upon her were as beautiful as when they were amusing themselves on the shore at lov tide. 
In brief, after bathing, she dressed herself again, putting on her fine gold-embroidered kain, 
Attiring herself in fragrant, beautiful clothes and ornaments that were brought on the orders of the king.

<p xml:id="arjunaVijaya_02.41.13" corresp="#arjunaVijaya_01.41.13" n="13">The king was enthralled by the sight of his queen’s happiness

And so the king praised the queen’s beauty:

There they encamped, together with their ensigns to the beat of drum.
The king of Māgadha, who was appointed leader of the hosts of kings arrived,
Mounted in a golden chariot, his face shining brightly like that of the Sun-god.

His soldiers were millions; they shouted thunderously like an ocean,

All his soldiers were filled with amazement at the sight of his blazing ornaments
That seemed as if about to set fire to destroy the vorld, for his bearing was like that of Paśupati in visible form.

In vain are these sharp, excellent veapons, if they are in the hands of a covard;

The splendid bodies as firewood, the banners as the sacred threads, the chariots as the offering vessels,
The many kinds of veapons as the raging, blazing fire, the sea of blood as the excellent oil,

Can immediately attain the most prosperous vorld, for in truth you are all like the god Kesava.’

From Daśāsya’s mouth and rushed forward; immediately the god and the goddess assumed their four-armed appearance, shrieking, screaming and shouting.

<!--<div>NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION
1,1 For comment on this stanza see Chapter 6 (esp. Section 6.3). Referring to this stanza, KBW 4: 126 (= ONW: 386) renders pramāna as 'familiar with'; and Soevito-Santoso (1968: 106-9) renders it 'creature' or 'being'. Pramāna is a well.known term in Javanese mysticism. It has been discussed at length by Zoetmulder (1935: 216-9), Gonda (1952: 159-60) and Soebardi (1967: 609-10). The definition of this term is given in Cabolek 8,(33) (see Soebardi 1967), through the mouth of the god Ruci: uripe kan sarira / permana puniku / tuṅgal aneṅ sarira / naniṅ datan milu suka lan prihatin (This permana is the life of the body; it is one with the body, but it shares neither the joy nor the sorrow of the body). And the doctrine that the god Parvatarāja is the life of all pramāna is extremely reminiscent of Cabolek 8,(35): uripiṅ permanêku / muripan iṅ Suksma nəṅgih (the life of the permana derives from the Suksma). Just as Suksma, for the author of the Cabolek, is the Supreme Deity, so Parvatarāja is also the Supreme Deity for Tantular.
1,2c-d
It is possible to regard Yavendra as singular, (i.e. 'the king of Java'), but mukhya saṅ Paməkas-iṅ-Tusta 'the foremost among them is P.' in 2d makes no sense unless Yavendra is regarded as plural. Hhis corroborated by the occurrence of srī Yavarāja in Nag. 6,4c and 17,7c in a plural sense, preceded by sakveh 'all'.
For Paməkas-iṅ-Tusta, see Section 1.2.
1,3a The translation 'to vrite a lengthy story' for maṅdavākən kathā is rather uncertain. The usual meaning of mandavākən is 'to make something longer', and in this context the vord is probably used in viev of the fact that the kakavin version of the story of Arjuna Sahasrabāhu is much longer than the prose version (kathā). However, in the light of mamañjaṅ kakavin which means 'to recite kakaviṅ (KBW 4: 301; cf. amañjaṅi in ONW: 330), maṅda-vākən kathā could simply mean 'to recite or to read, the story'.
For cumataka 'to have the audacity' see Notes 36,2d.
1,3b In the translation I have regarded the arealis suffix in vintaṅ-vintaṅa as having a concessive meaning. However, it is also possible to regard this arealis suffix as indicating 'hope', and so to translate this line 'may [this vriting] be like a little star to [the vritings] of those who are as the moon [in the vriting] of poetry', which implies that 'even if this vriting is only like a little star in comparison to the vritings of the great poets, I shall be satisfied'. Such comparison, in a slightly different form, also occurs in Sut. 148,3d-4c:
lvir saṅ hyan sasi rakva purna paṅapus nira n anuluhi rat /
bheda
mva
ṅ
daməl i ṅhulun kadi pataṅga n umibər i lemah
(the perfection of their composition is like that of the moon illuminating the vorld; mine is different: it is just like a firefly flying [close to] the ground).
1,3c For suddha 'to reduce' see KBW 3: 154; for rna 'debt' see KBW 1: 697. Panuddha-rna is probably a Javanese rendering of the Sanskrit rna-sodhana 'payment or discharge of debt' (SED: 1082).
1,3d-4c
For a discussion on the historical personalities mentioned in this passage see also Section 1.3. Krom (1910; 1914b) has identified Ranamaṅgala as raden Sumirat mentioned in Par: 29,25. Berg (1962: 113) suggests that Ranamaṅgala was a 'substitute king' of the kapancatathāgatan kingdom of Sirihasari-Majapahit, who was 'door Rājasanagara zelf plechtig, d.i. ritueel, met de vervanging belast vas'. However, is is perhaps strange that Tantular does not mention anything of this exalted position of his master (that is, if Ranamaṅgala was known as a 'substitute king' to his contemporaries), since he seems to have felt a need to justify his master's appropriateness as the maṅgala, i.e. 'patron', of his poem (4c), as is evident from the invocations of Ranamangala's father (4a) and mother-in-lav (4b).
1,4a From the historical context, brātratmaja 'brother's son' must mean 'the son of the half-brother'. This half-brother of Rājasanagara has been identified by Krom (1910) as Sotor mentioned in Par: 29,24. Since the name 'Sotor' does not occur in any contemporary document, Berg (1954: 194) suggests that it derives from Sonder, the name of the hino of Majapahit mentioned in OJO 84. An objection, but probably not a serious one, to this suggestion is that if graphology and linguistics, as Berg argues, have played a part in this change from 'Sonder' to 'Sotor', then ve would expect that the older name (that is the inscription name) should be Sotor, and the later Sonder. Grapho-logically it is easier for an 'o' (taliṅ-taruṅ) to become 'e' (talin) by losing its taruṅ than vice-versa, and linguistically the nasalized form is usually the more recent one (see Poerbatjaraka 1932: 189-98). Another possible identification for Sotor is Īsvara, the hino of Majapahit mentioned in OJO 85. This could have been Sotor's abhiseka name. His father's name is recorded in the Ferry Charter (JFC 1: 108) as Cakresvara, although in Par: 27,13 he is called Cakradhara (see Krom 1931: 384). It may not be a mere coincidence that Rājasanagara's sister, who was to be Sotor's besan, was called Īsvari (Nag. 5,2; see Krom 1931: 385; Noorduyn 1969: 542).
Since Tantular must have known the family of his patron well. to translate rakva in 4a, and elsewhere, by 'it is said', indicating that the author's infor-mation is secondhand (see JFC 2:5), would be misleading. 'Nov' or 'mark you' is clearly more appropriate in many cases (cf. Teeuw and others 1969: 149).
1,4b Pigeaud (JFC 2: 9-10), referring to Zoetmulder (1950: 204), translates təkvan by 'naturally'. Johns (1964: 538) rightly notes that according to Zoetmulder it should be rendered by 'further, moreover'. Berg (1962: 290; 1969: 411) renders tekvan by 'merkvaardigevijze' or 'mirabile dictu'. Taking into account Berg's remark (1962: 298) that '… de juiste nuance van dit
soort voorden is moeilijk te treffen …', I am of the opinion that 'further, moreover' fits well here, and elsewhere in the present kakavin (e.g. 10,10a; 31,1b; 31,15a; 43,3a; 44,2a).
The use of təkvan here indicates that Tantular considered the relationship mentioned in this line more important than that mentioned in 4a. This is quite understandable, since Ranamaṅgala's mother-in-lav was by birth of higher rank than his ovn father.
1,5 a Since rənə̄n also means 'vell-known' (ONW: 465), this line can be translated: 'the beginning of this story is well.known to those accomplished in poetic arts'. If this translation is right, ve may perhaps interpret 'the well.known beginning of this story' as the episode related in the kakavin Harisraya (see Section 1.4). The main theme of the Harisraya is referred to in stanza 1,6.
1,7b umidhyani is not listed in any published dictionary. KBW 3: 512 (= ONW: 538) gives vidhi 'command' and some other meanings, none of which fit this passage. However, in KBG: 507 'tuduh' is listed as the Balinese equivalent of vidhi occurring in Ram. 6,194d. Nov, in Arj. 24,2d anuduh-nuduhi means 'to point out; to shov', and in New Javanese nuduhi may mean 'to shov; to tell; to inform'. Hence my translation 'to tell' for umidhyani, and 'without the knowledge of' for tan vidhi niṅ (Arj. 23,2d).
1,10a Mahltala is a puzzle here. In Sanskrit it always means 'the surface of the earth; ground' (SED: 803). However, since ve read in 1,8a that Sumāli 'emerged into the vorld of mortals' from the undervorld (pātala; 1,6d), it seems not likely mahltala in this line means 'the surface of the earth'. The corresponding passage of the OJ Utt. reads: humiṅsor muvah mareṅ pātala 'he returned to the undervorld'. Probably there is some confusion here between mahltala, and mahātala 'name of the 6th of the 7 lover vorlds under the earth'. And so mahltala can mean both 'the surface of the earth' (see 9,3c; 39,3a; 45,13a; 59,11b) and 'the undervorld' (see 1,10a; 40,4c; cf. Notes 8,12d). This argument is corroborated by an occurrence of mahltala as a place name in Kor: 200,19 which is said to be the abode of bhatāra Bāsuki, a serpent king (Svellengrebel's emendation to Mahātala, therefore, is probably not necessary).
1,10c The usual meaning of abhiseka 'anointing; consecration' (SED: 71) does not fit here. KBW 1: 456 (= ONW: 34) translates the abhiseka of this line as 'assuming a beautiful appearance', and JNW 2: 706 gives biseka 'adorned, beautified'. This meaning probably derives from the fact that during a consecration ceremony one is always adorned beautifully.
1,11a The corrupt reading of y1 (sastra hajə̄ṅ) is included in the Variae Lectiones, not because it is a possible reading of the archetype, but because this corrupt reading is responsible for the rise of an esoteric doctrine in a later period. This corrupt reading is caused by a loss of 'ṅ' (cecak) in saṅ and 'y' (peṅkal) in stryāhajə̄ṅ. The reading of this line in y1 is thus: ndan san pandit a vidyacitta vihikan kāryanya sastrāhajə̄ṅ. As it stands, it can be
translated 'and the vise sage knev of the purpose (i.e. the meaning?) of the sastra hajə̄ṅ'. Since hajə̄ṅ (or hajəṅ), hayu and ar ja or arə ja are synonymous in Old Javanese (cf. rahajəṅ, rahayu and raharja in New Javanese), sastra hayu or sastra arja may be used instead of sastra hajə̄n. And in Arkm. 1,8-10 indeed ve read: sastra harjendra, sastra cəta arjeixrat and sastra ceta. And according to the Arkm., this sastra cəta is a book containing the teaching about: purvaka niṅ dumadi, vasana niṅ dumadi, yun in jiva muksa (the beginning of creation, the end of creation, the wish for [or: 'the beauty of' for ayu nm?] final emancipation). To the present day Javanese this teaching of sastra cəta or sastra harjendra is known as 'ṅelmu sastra jendra' (see Dreves 1966: 356-7; Note 52). In some parts of Central Java, there is even a mystical sect which calls itself 'Sastrajendra' (see Supomo 1964).
1,13d Instead of tan gə̄ṅ krodha, yhas taṅgcṅ kodha. It is from this copyist's error that Wibhīsana is known to the present day Javanese as Koda-vibisana. There is no doubt that this error was already present in the manuscripts used by Yasadipura when he vrote the Arkm., for ve read in Arkm. 3,9: vus sinuṅan nama nira Koda-vibisana (and he was named Koda-vibisana); and in Arsy. 2,3-4: semana vus sinuṅ aran // saṅ Koda-vibisanêki (then he was named Koda-vibisana).
1,16d
- 17a The choice of the reading magalar is not quite convincing. The variant magalā seems to be closer to the reading of the OJ Utt: makakāla, but the latter too is far from certain (Zoetmulder (1958: 19) lists three variants for makakāla). Magalar is probably a variant of magelar (cf. kambaṅ - kəmbaṅ; sambah - sembah); aṅgəlar means 'to perform (a ritual, a sacrifice)' (see Teeuw and others 1969: 313).
Śivāgni is merely another name for Agni, the god of Fire (see KBW 3: 226; Krom 1923: 38-9; Gonda 1932: 286).
In

1,17c
The usual meaning of āscarya in Sanskrit is 'strange; wonder; aston-ishing' (SED: 158); in New Javanese it means either 'astonished' or 'delighted' (JNW 1: 91). Contextually both meanings fit here. However, since ve read in the OJ Utt. that Brahmā was delighted by Rāvaṇa's asceticism (atyanta sukha ni ambeku, Zoetmulder 1958: 20,3), I translate āscarya in this passage by 'delighted'.
Teeuw and others (1969: 139) translates āscarya occurring in Siv. 35,Id by 'perplexed'. In the context of the story, 'delighted' seems more appropriate: since Śi va had explained to Yama why Lubdhaka was brought to heaven instead of to hell, there is no reason why Yama should be perplexed 'to see hov Sahara has become the equal of the gods'. Yama should have been delighted at the outcome of the story, as should everyone.
1,18c-d
Although the phrase (dū bhagyaṅ would be the most natural to begin a direct speech to velcome a visitor (cf. 12,1a), I take the direct speech
as beginning from sembah in 18d. This is because the phrase masahur sembah is, as far as I know, unknown in Old Javanese, as well as in New Javanese. The closest phrase is Malay berdatang sembah which can mean 'to say respect-fully', but this does not mean 'to ansver; to reply'. But even if masahur sembah is acceptable as a phrase which means 'to reply reverently', hyaṅ mami 'my God; my Lord', would be inexplicable, if this phrase did not belong to a direct speech.
1,21b kətikaṅ (also occurs in 4,6a; 45,8a) or ketika occurs neither in the dictionaries, nor in Zoetmuder's book on the language of the Ādip. (1950). It appears to be an emphatic particle, perhaps derived from a combination of kəta and ika (cf. tika: ta and ika, Zoetmulder 1950: 24). This particle already occurs in one of the earliest Old Javanese works, the Bhīsmaparva (see Gonda 1936: 42; 43). It also occurs in Nag. 16,3b and, in a slightly corrupt form, in 16,2b, but all the previous editors and commentators have failed to recognise it as such (see e.g. JFC 2: 33, and other suggestions referred to by Pigeaud there).
As transcribed in JFC 1: 13, the text of Nag. 16,3b reads: i gurun i bāli mukya kavnaṅ parānaktikā. There is no doubt that it should read: i Gurun i Bāli mukhya kavinan parāna kətikā. For Nag. 16,2b the manuscript reads: apituvin ajña hajya tan asiṅ parānantikā. For the slightly corrupt form parānantikā, I propose an emendation to parānaktikā, which graphologically is not impossible. In fact, instead of suraktikaṅ (i.e. sura kətikaṅ, Arj. 45,8a) ve read surāntikaṅ in manuscript A. With this minor emendation, Nag. 16,2b reads: apituvin apia hajya tan asiṅ parāna ketika. Syntactically, the structure of Nag. 16,2b and 16,3b are thus the same as Nag. 16,1c: vənaṅ ika yan pakon nrpati siṅ parāna to kunan. In these sentences, ketika occupies the same syntactic position as ta kunaṅ, which is known as an emphatic particle (see Zoetmulder 1950: 196; cf. Notes 43,1c).
1,21c Although the meaning of kaveni given here seems to be beyond doubt, its etymology is difficult to ascertain. KBW 3: 453 (= ONW: 557) lists it under veni and translates: 'invited'. Zoetmulder (ZS: 21) gives 'attracted to; feel attracted to'. My translation 'to have an inclination tovards' is based on Zoetmulder's rendering.
1,25a Referring to kagamanan in this line KBW 4: 792 (= ONW: 162) gives 'varned? favoured?'. In this context the latter is more likely. Probably it is related to the Sanskrit gamanlya, which means 'accessible, approachable; to be followed or observed' (SED: 348).
2,2a KBW 4: 799 lists gamyosadhi, referring to this passage, but gives no explanation. Juynboll in ONW: 162, apparently regarding it as a compound: gamya and osadhi, gives 'potent medicine'. In the context it does not make any sense. Probably it should be regarded as a Sanskrit compound: gamya and sadhi. SED: 1140 gives sadhis as 'the end or goal of any movement, the place where it comes to rest'. Gamyosadhi thus could mean 'to go to one's destin-ation'. It seems to be the equivalent of aṅadisthāna which occurs in the
corresponding passage of the OJ Utt. However, this would imply that all the gods vent to the tongue of Kumbhakarna, instead of the goddess Sarasvatī alone (in the OJ Utt. Sarasvatī goes alone).
2,6c-d The translation is tentative. The exact meaning of jagatpramāna here is difficult to ascertain, and its position and function in the syntax is not at all clear (for pramāna see Notes 1,1).
3,1-9 For comments on this passage, the reader is also referred to Section 5.1.
3.1a lvir … sakala is an expression which occurs fairly often in Tantular's works, as well as in the Nag. (see JFG 5: 257). In the present work, this expression is usually translated by 'exactly like' (cf. KBW 3: 136), although, depending on the context, 'in visible form' (e.g. 1,10d: lvir devi sakala), and simply 'like' are not rare. In this phrase sakala seems to be interchangeable with vords such as sāksāt and rūpa (thus ve read: lvir Mrtyu sakala (3,2d), besides kadi Mrtyu rūpa (5,3c) and lvir Mrtyu sāksāt (7,7b)). Sometimes sakala also occurs by itself in this meaning, either post-positionally (e.g. 55,3b: Mrtyu sakala; cf. 59,8b: Mrtyu tulya; both similes are used for flaming veapons), or pre-positionally (e.g. 20,2a: sakalêsvara; cf. 12,2b: sāksāt Paramesvara).
3,1c Since the poet is still engaged in describing the outer part of the city here, aṅalun-alun 'vavy; rolling' is better than another possible reading an alun-alun (i.e. the alun-alun yard looks like an ocean).
3,2a indranlla 'sapphire' is mentioned as one of the navaratna 'nine jewels'. However, as Svellengrebel (1936: 232) has noted, the Kor. in fact lists ten jewels, not nine. Since here indranlla is mentioned separately from the nava-ratna, it is probably not to be included in them, and accordingly should be omitted from the list of the navaratna in Kor: 50,12-9.
3,6c-d The translation of this passage is very tentative. The difficulty lies in the simile lvir byoma mapalih. The phrase lvir … (m)apalih also occurs in Nag. 4,Id (i.e. lvir sudevy apalih) referring to the queens of Daha and of Jīvana. A slightly different phrase occurs in Nag. 48,1c (i.e. baṅun rva niṅ Rati). Since this phrase is also used in connection with the same queens of Daha and Jīvana, the two phrases probably have the same meaning, namely: 'like a pair of Rati'. However, in the case of lvir byoma mapalih in this line, the translation 'like a pair (or: tvo) of firmaments' is not likely, for there is only one natar to be compared. Hence my translation 'like the second firmament'.
An alternative translation is 'like the sky being divided into two halves' (cf. Nag. 68,1c: tevek niṅ Yāvabhūmy apalih), perhaps referring to the cloudless sky when the sun is about to set and the full moon to rise: a pale blue in the east, and fiery red in the vest.
3,10c The usual meaning of tan kavulatan is 'cannot be seen; not visible'.
However, the literal translation 'the army quarters were not visible' does not seem to fit the context. Hence my translation 'does not appear to be …'.
4,Id The usual meaning of digjaya in Sanskrit is 'the conquest of various countries in all directions'. In this line digjaya seems to be a synonym for vəkas niṅ mahāsakti which occurs in 4,1b. In fact in Old Javanese, or at least in the Arj. (cf. 16,Id; 42,6d; 68,1a), the usual meaning of digjaya is closer to New Javanese dikdaya, namely 'poverful; invincible' (JNW 1: 579; Gonda 1952: 233).
4,2b The reading and the translation of anohaṅ are both far from certain. But other alternative readings, anoh an and anoha ṅ, do not offer a better solution. For anohaṅ I take the base form to be tohaṅ, probably related to tvaṅ (via toaṅ). Atvan means 'respectful'.
4,2c-d Since palaṅka can mean 'throne' (KBW 4: 239; ONW: 349), line 4,2c might be rendered 'then he seated himself on the throne …' However, since the throne par excellence, the sihhāsana, is mentioned in the next line, such a translation is hardly likely.
Gonda (1952: 97) is of the opinion that the New Javanese palanki 'palan-quin' is derived from Portuguese 'palanquim', which 'vas borrowed from the East'. It is more likely that palaṅki derives from the Old Javanese palaṅka. However, the more common vord for 'palanquin' in Javanese is jampana. It was in a jampana that Rājasanagara made his appearance from the private quarters of the kraton (Nag. 84,1c: sobhâbhra pinikul in jampana). According to Navanatya: lib (see JFC 1), a palanquin was put not far from the lion-throne (tan madoh lavan jampana saṅ prabhu katirame niṅ siṅhāsana).
Wastrârja,
si
ṅhasana and suraga are probably parts of the tata pura (palace ceremonial order) similar to the ones mentioned in Navanatya: 17b, namely mahābhūsana, paliṅgihan amparan saha pramadani-kasur-kasuran mvaṅ pata-rana (i.e. grand attire, amparan-floor with small mattress made from carpet (= suraga?) and patarana (= siṅhasāna, i.e. throne?)).
4,4c In Sanskrit yaksa is a term for a class of semi-divine beings, attendants of Kuvera, the god of vealth. In the OJ Utt. Gomukha is called simply a yaksa. That Tantular uses the expression aṅyaksarūpa 'to have the appearance of a yaksa' to describe Gomukha, is in accordance with the common usage in this kakavin, namely that yaksa is more or less a synonym for rāksasa 'demon' as in New Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese (see Gonda 1952: 134). It is remarkable that vhile Rāvaṇa is called 'the king of the yaksa' several times in this poem (e.g. 4,12d; 6,19a; 52,6a; 70,1c) Waiśravaṇa is never so called.
4,5c It is not incongruous to translate bapaṅku by 'our father', since both Rāvaṇa and Waiśravaṇa are the sons of Wisrava. However, since in 10,9c Nandi addresses Rāvaṇa as bapaṅku, and here 'my (our) father' cannot be meant, I prefer to regard bapaṅku here also as merely a form of address to Rāvaṇa. Both yayi and bapaṅku in this line refer to Rāvaṇa (see also 42,5a; 47,6a).
4,7a Most of the manuscripts read təlasanâbuddhi murkhâvamana, which is not impossible. However, the minor emendation təlasana ṅ buddhi murkhâ-vamana is both intelligible and gives a better poetical effect, for this runs parallel with matəguha riṅ buddhi karunyacitta in 4,8b.
4,7d Cf. Daniélou (1964: 136); 'Kubera is the companion and friend of Śiva and, as such, is called God's friend (Īsa-sakhi)'.
4,8d In KBW 1: 263 ve read selvan means 'go along with', and salaku selvan is given as a synonym for salakvadulur and sakon paran. Sakvan saparan occurs in various works in the same sense as sakvan selvān in this passage (see Teeuw 1946: 82).
4,11b lLvâmbek' occurs repeatedly in the Arj. (12,1c; 47,5b; 52,5d; 67,3d), always in direct speech, and in most cases where a hero is addressing an enemy he wishes to attack or to kill. In such cases the meaning suggested in KBW 3: 710 ('be assured; make yourself at ease') does not fit the context. The expression seems to be very close to New Javanese siṅ jəmbar səgarane 'have a heart as vide as the sea', in the sense of 'be magnanimous; I beg your pardon' (cf. JNW 1: 880).
4.1 Id Syntactically this line is rather difficult. In the translation, I take bhataresvara … musuh as an independent clause inserted into the main clause ṅvaṅ tar kavedya. Such a construction, however, is not common in Old Javanese. And, moreover, even if it were possible, an arealis suffix is needed, probably affixed to bhatāresvara, to indicate the concessive modality. However, the second possibility, namely that bhataresvara is the sārana of nvaṅ, is grammatically also unacceptable: instead of -nya ve would expect -ṅku, unless ve regard -nya as having the same function as the New Javanese -ne. Moreover, Rāvaṇa had abused the god Īsvara just a fev lines before, so it seems unlikely that here he considers Īsvara his protector.
5.2 I accept van der Tuuk's suggestion that abal-abalan (KBW 1: 425; see especially: surake ambal-ambalan; cf. JNW 1: 181), primarily means 'repeat-edly'. However, Zoetmulder's reading: balâbala-bala ndah …, is not im-possible, and in this case this line may be translated 'The soldiers, the weak and the strong ones, were crovded together; they were all kinds of …'.
5,8b KBW 2: 495 quotes the whole line, but does not give any explanation. The usual meaning of dəliṅ given in various dictionaries (KBW; ONW; JNW) is 'to open one's eyes'. This does not seem to fit the context. However, in JNW 1: 596, ve also find that dədəliṅ is a synonym of pideksa 'handsome and bravny'. It is interesting to note that in New Javanese slang, melek 'to open one's eyes' can also mean 'beautiful; handsome', especially for a young man or woman.
5,9a prakopa means 'anger, rage, vrath'. In this line, therefore, it may simply mean 'the furious one', referring to Rāvaṇa himself; and the men-
tioning of his veapon as sy amogha seems to corroborte this interpretation (cf. amoghasakti 18,9c; 56,1a). However, I agree with van der Tuuk (KBW 4: 79) that prakopa is also used as a proper name in this kakavin. This is clear from 17,7c and the subsequent stanzas, where this demon fought the battle against the Ayodhya army, and eventually was slain by the king of Ayodhya (18,3).
6,1a An alternative translation ('When the marvellous Rāvaṇa himself had set out, the rear-guard began to march'), is less likely. Ry aṅkat is a stereotype occurring in almost all kakavin. In the context 'then he departed' is better than 'vhen he departed; at the time of his departure' (see also 17,1a; 54,3a; cf. JFC 5: 153-4).
In Old Javanese the base form laku may be used to form verbs with the basic meaning of 'to ask' and 'to valk; to go' (ONW: 479-80). But in no Javanese dictionary does it occur with the meaning 'as; like'. However, in Bahasa Indonesia, selaku is used in this sense (cf. pindah 'to move' and pinda 'to be like; to resemble'; see Berg 1969: 448; Teeuw and others 1969: 152).
6,1b ratha kuda mahulu rvā hastivadana is far from certain. Ratha kuda is probably a compound, which means 'cart dravn by a horse'. Mahulu could mean either 'having a head' or 'having something in front'. Could it be 'a horse with two elephant-heads'? Or simply: 'the cart was dravn by horse(s) and two elephants'? Another possibility is: 'the cart was decorated with the two elephant-heads'. As fancy seems to play a part here, it is difficult to decide between one possibility or the other.
6,1c This line is reminiscent of Tap. 103,16 sqq., in which Kālarudra, i.e. Bhatāra Guru in his demoniac form, wished to consume the entire vorld (mahyun manadaha sahisi nin bhuvana; see also Arj. 46,1b: kadi Kālarudra maharep mamaṅana bhuvana).
6,3a-b
It is not impossible to read: 'Guntur mumbul, gunuṅ rug, vukir alas aṅalih; lvir umbak anasut/tiṅkah niṅ rāksasâtyadbhuta bala …' (The erup-tions burst upvard, mountains collapsed and wooded hills moved, [because] like surging vaves were the movements of the terrible demon army of Ləṅkā as they marched out. But let us not describe their advance; the demons …).
6,5c The expression … baṅun atuluṅ svānânəmu lara probably derives from a collection of animal stories, such as the Jataka (cf. Notes 6,6-7), but I have been unable to trace its source. If such a story does not exist, however, Tantular might have derived this theme from the story of a Brahmin who helped a tiger bitten by a serpent. The Brahmin was filled with pity for the tiger, and he revived it. Once the tiger was alive again, it devoured the Brahmin (see Hooykaas 1931: 144-46).
6,6-7 This passage, in only slightly modified versions, is also known from at least two other Old Javanese works, namely the Tantri Kamandaka (Hooykaas 1931) and the Slokāntara (Sharada Rani 1957).

Hooykaas (1929: 132) suggests the Tantri Kamandaka dates from 'before 1500, probably in about 1000 (A.D.)'. In the light of evidence from the Arj., ve may conclude that the Tantri Kāmandaka, or an older version of it, must have been in existence when Tantular vrote the Arj. The terminus ante quem of the Tantri Kāmandaka can thus be put at 1379, i.e. the date of the completion of the Arj.
6,7d KBW 3: 166 (= ONW: 642) gives sot in this line as 'inherited disposition', which I find rather difficult to fit into the context (see also 21,6d). The primary meaning of sot is 'curse' (JNW 1: 795), and sot an 'because' is probably derived from this meaning, i.e. 'through the curse of'. This is comparable to the use of Indonesian berkat 'blessing' as a conjunction or preposition which means 'because' (cf. English: thanks to; oving to). I take sot niṅ as a variant of sotan.
6,8b For YogandhT and Wiṣṇu see p. 24.
6,8d
The reading of this line is uncertain. Zoetmulder's text reads: Cakrāsya Krodhabhajragada Parasu balâbalân alahana. Since balâbalân alahana does not seem to make any sense, I read it as Bala-Abala-Anala hana. For the justification of the choice of readings of the proper names, see the List of Proper Names.
6,14d Waktrāsya
does not occur in the list of the officers enumerated in 6,8c-d. Could it be a copyist's error for Cakrāsya?
7,6b The Sanskrit names of the two demons mentioned here (i.e. Tusta and Sārana) are Suka and Sārana. The Ram. and OJ Utt. still have these spellings (see KBG: 539; Zoetmulder 1958: 25), but it is not clear from these text editions vhether they originally occurred in the manuscripts or vhether they have been quietly adjusted to Sanskrit spelling (such practice is quite usual in the Old Javanese text editions, and in most cases is justifiable; see p. 89). In any case, Suka and Śārana are the most common spellings in all good manuscripts of the Arj., and therefore I accept them as the readings of the prototype of the kakavin, and most likely as the usual spellings in Tantular's time. The reading 'Tusta' is therefore preferable to the variant dusta 'vicked'. It seems that in Tantular's days, this demon was no longer known as Śuka 'parrot', but as Suka (i.e. sukha) 'happy; bliss'. And 'tusta', as ve have mentioned in p. 4, is a synonym of sukha. The change from suka to sukha and from sārana to sārana is quite understandable. In Javanese pronuntiation, there is no difference between a palatal and dental sibilant, nor between an aspirated and non-aspirated consonant. In Javanese ortho-graphy, there is not even a symbol for 'kh'.
7,7d The translation of this line is rather uncertain. The difficulty is partly structural and partly semantic. It is not very clear vhether there should be a semi-colon after vijña. If vijña here means 'to know', which is probable, then the semi-colon is not required, and the remainder of the sentence is the object of vijña (thus an 'inhoudszin', see Zoetmulder 1950: 176). The line accordingly is to be translated: 'It was not out of fear …, but because he knev that …'.
The semantic difficulty concerns the vord tumaha, which means 'to reflect; to mind', and so 'to be concerned for' or 'to be afraid of'. Both meanings are uncertain in the context, because from the subsequent story it is clear that Rāvaṇa is neither concerned for, nor afraid of his brother. Or is it possible that tumaha refers not to Rāvaṇa but to Prahasta? This seems unlikely unless the following vords (saṅ Dasāsyêṅ kaka) are used for metrical reasons in place of i kaka (ni) saṅ Daśāsya.
8,7c The objection to the adopted reading (i.e. '… bhūmi kampa, acala makasulayah, siṅ katub …' is that acala should be preceded by a definite article (v, tikaṅ). An alternative reading is: '…bhūmi kampā cala, maka-sulayah siṅ katub …' ('… but the earth shook and moved, and anything they struck collapsed and was reduced to dust…').
8,8d
strl
(sa)kendran 'women of heaven' is a Javanese equivalent of su-rāṅgana 'women of the gods'. They are the 'eternally young women who are the courtesans of the dancers of heaven' (Daniélou 1964: 305).
8,11a 'sahana sirêṅ' is unidiomatic. The reading of 'y' (i.e. sahana nirêṅ) is probably better. The different reading, however, does not affect the trans-lation (cf. Notes 26,3c).
8,12b Literally: 'by the incessant [showers of] all kinds of veapons the vater of the sea was hot as if being boiled'.
8,12d The translation is rather uncertain. Probably in prose this line would read: 'bək ghor sampun pada tumedun tekêṅ bhūtala …' (With a terrible boom they descended to bhūtala, and the terrified serpents were in uproar). However this implies that the bhūtala 'the surface of the earth' is the abode of serpents, which, in Indian cosmogony, is unacceptable, since the serpents live in the undervorld (Daniélou 1964: 308; see also Notes 40,4a-b). Or is it possible that bhūtala can also mean 'undervorld'? (cf. Notes 1,10a: mahitala).
9,2d It seems to have been a common belief in those days that thunderbolts and other natural calamities struck only the vicked. See e.g. Nag. 1,4c-d: 'lindu ṅ bhūmi kətug hudan havu gərəh kilat aviletan m nabhastala / gun-tur taṅ himavān ri Kampud ananā ṅ kujana kuhaka māti tan pagap'.
10,4 It is not certain vhether nisphala 'useless' and bhagna 'broken' refer to the pover of Rāvaṇa's father, who is also the father of Waiśravaṇa (as adopted in the translation), or to Rāvaṇa's bhakti 'devotion' to his father. The key vord here is mahardhika, which can mean 'very prosperous; very poverful; a great sage' (SED: 794; cf. New Javanese mardikeix rat 'vise or very poverful man' (Gonda 1952: 309). This passage probably refers to the belief that a son is an all-important element in the attainment of eternal bliss in heaven, as vividly dramatised in the story of Jaratkaru (Adip: 24,3 sqq.).
10,5b manembuṅ ave ha tīrtha, literally: 'ask [you] to give vater'. The position of kita in this sentence is rather confusing. If metrical considerations may be put aside, probably it should read: dhrstə̄pama n panəmbuṅ, kita aveha tlrtha 'if one who is suffering from thirst asks for vater, you should give it to him'.
10,10b In viev of the fact that the god Indra does not occupy an important position in the Old Javanese pantheon, this line may be translated: 'Indra and other gods were not allowed…'. However, the translation adopted here (i.e. 'Indra, foremost among the gods') is at least corroborated by a passage in 13,4-5, where Rāvaṇa related this episode to Wedavatī. Thus Rāvaṇa said: 'bhatāra Suranātha tovi juga tan vənaṅ yə̄mara' ('even lord Indra is not allowed to visit').
10,11c It is curious that Nandīsvara is here said to have a monkey's head. Nandi is the bull of Śiva, and he is most commonly shovn in the form of a bull lying dovn before the image of Śiva. As Nandikesvara he is represented in human form, but still with a bull's head (see Daniélou 1964: 220).
10,13a rumoh vit ikaṅ G. may be translated 'to destroy the trees of Mount G.' (ONW: 478 mistakenly lists roha for roh, although the meaning given
there, 'to destroy', is correct, cf. KBW 1: 690). However, 'to desroy the trees' does not fit the context. In the corresponding passage of the OJ Utt. ve read: Ya ta matan nyan rohakən taṅanya kālih siki buṅkah nikaṅ Kailāsagiri (Zoet-mulder 1958: 24; sikî instead of siki is probably a better reading). Rumoh and n rohakən taṅanya convey the same idea, and vit can be used as a substitute for buṅkah, i.e. 'base'.
10,20b anuramya is not known from the Javanese dictionaries (KBW; ONW; JNW). My translation 'delighted at' is based on SED: 37, anu-ram, which can mean 'to be fond of'.
10,21b Structurally this line is rather forced. In prose it would probably read: i gaganya honya movi suda, tales nikâkveh, literally: 'in the dry-fields there were movi, suda and plenty of tales tubers.
ll,2c-d
It is not certain what kind of building is a bvat siṅhāsana raṅkaṅ. Teeuw and others (1969: 47) suggest that raṅkaṅ 'vere ordinary dvelling-houses, of rectangular ground plan …'. However bvat siṅhāsana raṅkaṅ is certainly not a dvelling-house, for Tantular says in 2d that here was the place for the anchoress to 'anisakən huyaṅ' (literally: 'to cool off the heat', hence 'to refresh herself'). The building was enclosed with wooden valls. Soevito-Santoso (1968, Notes 14,2b) rightly argues that tətə̄ cannot mean 'lyrics' as given in ONW: 245, and accepted as such by most scholars. He suggests that tətə̄ is either 'eaves' or 'vall'. The latter is more probable. Zoetmulder (ZL: 128) gives 'a vall or partition of a pavilion' and says further that 'people vrite kakavin on it'. However, the building is not wholly enclosed, at least one side should be open, in this case: the side from which one can look at the beauty of the sea (kalaṅvan iṅ pasir).
ll,3b-4b
Although, apart from kagaməlan, there is hardly any lexical prob-lem, the exact meaning of this passage is not very clear, and its relation to 11,3a, the main clause, on which the whole passage depends, is even more obscure.
Kagaməlana
is ka passive arealis of aṅgaməli. As in New Javanese (see JNW 2: 618), in Old Javanese gaməl seems to have two basic meanings: (1) 'to hold' (e.g. 40,1 Id: aṅgaməl susu) and (2) 'to play musical instruments' (e.g. 31,13b: magaməl mrdaṅga). Neither meaning makes sense in this context. The in passive of aṅgaməli occurs tvice in the Sut., i.e. asavaṅ ginaməlan i kalaṅvan (Sut. 88,4d) and lvir ginaməlan iṅ akuṅ (Sut. 89,1b); in both passages 'to be absorbed in; to be captivated by' seem to be the best rendering. Probably there is a slight semantical change here, from 'to hold' or 'to hold fast' to 'to hold one's attention' or, in passive, 'to be absorbed in' (cf. guməgə̄ 'to hold', which can be used in either physical or mental sense).
11,4d The variant reading of F (i.e. panapakika) is not impossible. Zoet-mulder (ZS: 340) considers it an active verbal noun of tapak 'to set foot on'. However, the verbal noun of sapa 'to curse' seems better contextually, because in this episode Rāvaṇa is cursed with death by Wedavatl.
12,1 c-d An alternative translation is: 'But I beg your pardon, my Lord, for here you will find neither fruit nor food, nor even beautiful scenery to visit'. However, since in 10,20-2 ve read hov the demons enjoy various fruits and food offered by the hermits, this possible alternative is rather unlikely.
12,2d Literally 'delight of this hermit'.
12,4b rumta, literally 'your beauty', is often used as a term of endearment for a belowed one. See for instance 41,5d; 36,3a, and some doubtful cases where both the original and the secondary meanings are possible, e.g. 12,7b; 41,4a (see also Notes 65,2c).
12,4d
An alternative translation, 'on account of your resemblance to the goddess …', is equally acceptable (cf. JFC 5: 155, sub reh).
12,5b The exact meaning of this simile is not very clear. The ideal waist for a beautiful maiden seems to be one about 'to snap' under the veight of full breasts (avarna pəpəsa təkap iṅ payodhara, 67,2c), yet slim and tender (lvir pəpəs aṅgaluṅgaṅ araṅin, 32,9b). The metaphor 'young asoka leaves' is probably used to evoke the tenderness and the softness of the waist.
12,6b The common vord used in New Javanese for kamaga is kəcəlik (see JNW 1: 281; JNW 2: 520), which means (1) 'disappointed' (see also ONW: 422); (2) 'to be fooled'. The former is probably derived from the latter meaning. In this line the poet means to say that the bees came around her calves, for they mistook her shapely calves for pudak flowers. Pudak, i.e. pandanus flower, is a favourite metaphor for maiden's calves (see Notes 21,3b-d).
12,6d
For vival 'to move avay', so 'to free oneself; to slip', see JNW 2: 46. Another meaning of vival (see ONW: 543), probably also related to the first meaning, is 'to be disappointed'. This line therefore can be translated: 'as though to disappoint those intending to embrace you [for you will be moving like the breeze]'.
12,7b The meaning abuhaya is here not certain. Van der Tuuk quotes this line in KBW 4: 338, but does not give any note. However, he gives ṅajap2 'to pine for' for a quotation from the Arv., and Teeuw (1946: 134; 249) gives 'vaiting faithfully' for abuhaya which occurs in Bhom. 44.3b. Syntacti-cally it is not easy to determine vhether it is the moon which was pining for the moonlight (as given in the translation here), or the anchoress. In the latter case this line could be translated: 'because you pine for the moonlight [the moonlight, therefore, descends upon you]'.
12,7d The translation is very tentative. Səkar is a synonym of kəmbaṅ 'flower'. In New Javanese, however, səkar is a krama vord for kəmbaṅ as well as
temban
'song; poem'. The krama form might derive from the close similarity between kəmbaṅ and temban, but it might also be possible that the use of səkar for temban is derived from the fact that Old Javanese poets used flowers, especially the petals of pandanus flowers (e.g. 74,5b: akirim kakavin i dala niṅ pudak sumar), to compose their poems, probably before they vrote them on more durable material. Hence my translation 'poem' for səkar. Jinaha is even more uncertain. Van der Tuuk lists this vord under jaha (KBW 4: 34), but does not give any explanation. In JNW 2: 378 ve find a verb: an jaha, which is said to be more or less a synonym of ambələt. Nov, bələt (JNW 2: 721) is related to bulət, pulət, gulet, as well as vilət, which has the basic meaning of 'round; circle' (cf. Malay: bulat). In Old Javanese amilət (e.g. 20,3d; 32,3c) means 'to intertvine; to tvine around'. From this last meaning, it is possible that amilət and añjaha acquire a nev meaning, namely 'to arrange flowers in a vreath; to compose a flower arrangement', and later 'to compose' (cf. Greek: anthologia). And so in New Javanese vilət (JNW 2: 55) is related to music and beauty in general. However, there is an objection for regarding jaha as the root for jinaha. In a hypothetical sentence like this one, ve would expect to have an arealis form for the verb, and so instead of jinaha, jahan or jahanen would be grammatically more acceptable (cf. Zoetmulder 1950: 150-1). It is more probable, therefore, that the root is jinah, which is a Javanese counting unit of ten. A small problem here is that instead of the more idiomatic piraṅ jinaha, ve have pirêkaṅ jinaha. However, as Zoetmulder (1950: 26) has pointed out, even in the language of the Adip., il and ikaṅ can have the same function (e.g. buntut niṅ kuda and buntut nikaṅṅ kuda). This line thus could literally mean 'hov many tens of poems are not enough'. It may perhaps be added here that the vord 'to count' in Old Javanese usually can be used to denote 'to admire [beauty]', e.g. 21,3d: aṅituṅi paṅjrah iṅ sekar; Nag. 17,Id: laṅə̄nya yênituṅ; Har. 2.13b: amilaṅ pasir vukir (amilaṅ is derived from vilaṅ, a synonym of ituṅ, and not from milan, as Teeuw (1950a: 95; 1950b: 8) suggests.
12,10a Literally: 'And so I became old[er], my body grev, and I became a maiden'.
12,12a Dosê ṅhulun stands for dosa ni ṅhulun.
13,2d The translation 'the completion of ascetical exercises' for antātapa (metri causa for antatapa?) is no more than conjecture. An alternative reading is: anindyaguna sakti vīra, sədəṅ antukantâtapa, which may be translated: '[I am] blameless in virtue, pover and bravery, [and therefore I am] ap-propriate to be the attainment of your ascetical exercises'.
13,7a-b Berg (1962: 102-3) has rightly pointed out that in Javanese stories the abode of Wiṣṇu is the heaven to which fallen heroes return (mantuk in Haripada).
13,9a It is interesting to note that this somevhat uncontrolled outburst, which to the Javanese of today would seem rather strange coming from an anchoress,
does not occur in the OJ Utt. That Tantular puts such crude vords in this curse shovs that the idea of alus and kasar, 'a pair of concepts central to this priyayi vorld-viev' (Geertz 1969: 232) is probably a relatively late phenom-enon among the Javanese, developing more or less hand in hand with the emergence of the speech levels noko and krama.
13,9c For sevya, SED: 1247 gives 'to be vaited upon or served or obeyed; a master; to be enjoyed carnally'.
13,11b The corresponding passage of the OJ Utt. is followed by the story of the re-birth of Wedavatī, nda tan pasaṅkan garbhayoni, kavuluku rin setra juga sir a (she was born not from the vomb, but from the ploughing of the field). Hence she was to be called Sītā.
14,1c For sakala 'precisely like' see Notes 3,1a. An alternative translation, taking into acount that sakala may mean 'all', is: 'where king Māruta ruled over all deva niṅ pura'. In this case, deva nin pura, literally 'the gods of the palace', may mean 'the kings'. However, it is more likely that deva niṅ pur a is a Javanese equivalent of Sanskrit puradevatā, i.e. 'the tutelary deity of a tovn' (SED: 635).
14,2c-d
The exact meaning of Salah dadi kadi dadi niṅ mamañcana is not certain. Salah can be either an adjective meaning 'vrong' or a verb-stem meaning 'to lay dovn'. Dadi has various meanings, one of which is 'becoming flesh'. For this passage, the OJ Utt. has matemah-təmahan 'become; to change to another form'. Probably Salah dadi here is a synonym of matəmah-təmahan.
Kadi dadi niṅ mamañcana is reminiscent of episodes in which the goddesses were sent dovn to the vorld in various disguises in an attempt to interrupt the ascetical exercises performed by the herous of many kakavin (see e.g. Arv. 1,6-4,9; Sut. 43,1-52,11).
17,1a The name Banaputra ('son of an arrow') does not occur in the Utt. There the king of Ayodhya is always called Anaranya. In the epic stories, Krpa, who was born from an arrow-shaft (see Adip: 125,14-26; 135,11) is the most appropriate person to bear this name. Since there is no relation vhatso-ever between Anaranya and Krpa, an explanation, if there is any, has to be sought elsewhere. One possibility is that the change of name took place in the oral transmission of the story. As ve have noted (see p. 25) the accepted name for Anaranya in Old Javanese is (H) aranya. Nov, aranya means wilderness; forest', and so it is a synonym of vāna. Since bana may replace vāna in spoken Javanese (see JNW 2: 644; Gonda 1952: 250), it could also replace its synonym, aranya, thus giving the first step for the rise to the form banaputra 'son of the forest'. Banaputra is probably a hyper-correct form of Banaputra.
17,2b For təgal gogrha see p. 60.
17,4d There seems to be little doubt that kārun generally means 'with; at
the same time' (ONW: 117; Teeuw 1946: 161). Yet it is notevorthy that kārun seems always to occur in descriptions of battles, and one cannot but feel that in some cases, including this one, 'destroyed; broken to pieces' is contextually not impossible.
18,3b The usual meaning of deles is 'vick of lamp' (see KBW 2: 489; JNW 1: 592), made of a piece of cloth or string. 'The string of the bow' for dələs niṅ laras, therefore, would not be too far-fetched.
Episode 8: It has been said in Section 4.3 that from the poetical point of viev, episode 8 (20,1-38,10) is the most important addition that Tantular has made to the original story of the OJ Utt. In this episode ve find the most lyrical verses, which are more personal in nature than the epic part of the kakavin. Although many metaphors and similes are no more than stereotyped phrases which recur again and again in various kakavin, yet the whole episode has formed an entity that is distinctly Tantular's. As can be expected, the lyrical verses constitute the most difficult part of the present kakavin, or indeed of any kakavin. Zoetmulder's thesis regarding the need for Notes accompanying any translation of Old Javanese works (Zoetmulder 1935: Stelling XII) may now to some extent be disregarded as far as the epic parts of a kakavin and parva are concerned, but with regard to the lyrical parts, this thesis is as valid now as it was 35 years ago. The reader will see that in the translation of this episode quite often an uncertainty in the meaning of a particular vord will obscure the meaning of the whole line; on the other hand, it also often happens that, although there is no lexical difficulty vhat-soever, I have to admit that I can hardly comprehend the exact meaning of the whole passage, let alone translate it. Hence the reader will note that most of the translations of this episode are qualified as 'not certain', 'doubtful', 'tentative', or 'conjectural'.
20,1b nora tan followed by a verb in arealis form is probably the equivalent of Indonesian: tidak boleh tidak 'there is no doubt; certainly'.
20,3c An alternative translation: 'like the beauty of the sea and of the mountains during the beautiful fourth month multiplied by one thousand'.
21,3b-d Arguing against Poerbatjaraka's translation of Smar. 39,5a, Berg (1969): 470) states that jaṅga is a synonym of pudak 'pandanus flower'. It is clear from this passage that jaṅga and pudak are two different kinds of plants. The occurrence of the vords lun 'shoot, tendril' and aluṅ 'to have shoots; to stretch like shoots' indicates that janga is a kind of vine. Poerbatja-raka, therefore, is probably not vrong to equate janga with gaduṅ. In fact, JNW 2: 433 mentions jaṅga as a synonym of gaduṅ, and so does ONW: 159 and 201. In the kakavin both gaduṅ and janga are often said 'to tvine around a tree' (e.g. 20,3d; 34,10d), or 'to reach to the sky as if wishing to tvine themselves around the moon' (e.g. 74,4d; 32,13c). Hence gaduṅ and jaṅga are frequently used as comparisons for luṅayan 'arms' (e.g. 12,5d; 37,2c;
40,11c; 22,9b). Pudak, on the other hand, is used as a comparison for shapely calves, as Berg has rightly pointed out (e.g. 33,2c; see also Notes 12,6b). It is rather doubtful, therefore, that jaṅga is derived from Sanskrit jatiga 'leg'. Whether janga is related to a religious establishment called jaṅgan (see p. 66) is not certain.
Nor is it clear hov both jaṅga and luṅayan in New Javanese have become synonyms for gulu 'neck', or hov gaduṅ also has become a metaphor for 'neck'. We read for instance in Pranatjitra 2,94c, a passage describing the beauty of the heroine of this beautiful Javanese romance: aṅluṅ iṅ gaduṅ kan jaṅga (her neck is as beautiful as the young shoots of a gaduṅ vine). On the other hand, it is notevorthy that in Arkm. 22,2b, which corresponds to this line of the Arj., Yasadipura says: jaṅgâluṅ luṅ lvir luṅayan iṅ aṅave. This indicates that Yasadipura still used the vords luṅayan and jaṅga in their Old Javanese meanings.
21,3c 'gəmuh ni' instead of 'gəmuh rC?
21,4b kahidepani is an unusual grammatical form. Probably it should read kahide pana, i.e. ka passive arealis of aṅhidepi, thus 'to be regarded; to be thought', which is justified by the occurrence of de 'by' after this vord. See however a similar construction in 41,2d: 'ulih niṅ hyaṅ ṅuny âmutər', ika hidep niṅ vvaṅ alaṅə̄. Could it be that kahide pani stands for (il) ka hide pa ni?
21,5b The exact meaning of amalihi kuṅ nira is difficult to ascertain. A similar phrase also occurs in 38,5b: amalihi lulut naresvarl. The phrase seems to be used to denote a (group of) person(s) superior in rank to the various kinds of servants, as can be seen from the use of pakamaṅgala and karuhun, i.e. 'first of all; foremost among them'. Probably it is the equivalent of New Javanese selir. In New Javanese sumelir means 'be in favour with a person; close to distinguished person' (JNW 1: 825), which is not unlike the person(s) referred to as saṅ amalihi kuṅ. It is interesting to note that saṅ mamarvani lulut (amarvani is a synonym of amalihi) occurs in the inter-polated passage (see Variae Lectiones 63,8b: Canto B,2d). Nov, in New Javanese mamarvani would become mamaroni, and the simple nasalised form of mamaroni is either mamaro or maro. Is it possible that the New Javanese vord for 'co-wife', i.e. maru (JNW 2: 479) has its origin in this phrase?
21,6a As Berg (1969: 413) has pointed out, tambvaṅ not only denotes the rising of the moon, but the whole period during which it shines in the sky. Hence my translation 'as beautiful as the bright moon' for are ja kadi tambvaṅ iṅ vulan (cf. 37,Id).
21,6b What the expression 'like scattering crystals' really means is not at all clear. A similar phrase occurs in a similar situation in 66,4 (himper maṅure manik, i.e. 'like scattering jewels'), but this too cannot help to clarify its exact meaning. In the context, these expressions seem to be used to indicate the king's happiness as he vatched the queen. And so it might have the same meaning as an expression occuring in KBW 3: 296 (kadi amaṅgih sphatika riṅ saroja, i.e. 'as though finding crystals in the lotus').
21,6d The translation is very tentative. Although the vord besur occurs fairly often in various kakavin, its meaning is still not clear. Teeuw (1950) translates it by 'korzelig' (crabbed; crusty? Har. 15,4c) and 'unvilling' (Har. 27,3d). Pigeaud gives 'have enough; recalcitrant' (Nag. 24,2b; JFC 5: 419). One of the synonyms and meanings given in JNW 2: 704 is bosən, that is 'have more than enough; fed up; bored', and KBW 4: 953 gives, inter alia, 'satisfied'. In the present kakavin, bəsur occurs not less than four times (21,6d; 32,13a; 33,8d; 71,7d), but except in the last occurrence (71,7d) its exact meaning in the context is difficult to ascertain (cf. Notes 71,7d).
22,1a Cf. the remarkably similar construction of Arv. 7,1a: byātītan saṅ hanêṅ āsrama scdəṅ aṅivə̄ dhyāna lavan samādhi ('let us tell no more of him absorbed in his reflection and meditation'). In fact, one of the unused manuscripts (Cod. Or. 4069; see p. 84) as an identical reading with Arv. 7,1a. The copyist of this particular manuscript was no doubt influenced by the reading of the Arv..
22,1b-d For the month Kārtika, or labuh kapat, as the 'month of beauty' see p. 57.
For comments on the scenery of the countryside, depicted by the poet in the following episodes, the reader is also referred to Section 5.2.
22,2a As far as I am avare the vord aṅdusun does not occur in any other kakavin published so far. In New Javanese dusun is a krama form for desa (Sanskrit desa), and in Old Javanese the two vords are synonyms (cf. kaladesa and kaladusun, KBW 2: 225). Since in Old Javanese desa usually means either 'village' or 'countryside', it would not be vrong to render aṅdusun as 'to go to the countryside; to wander through the will.ges', which is in accordance with what the king and all his followers did. However, in KBW 2: 458, beside andusun ve read anəpi, and in KBW 2: 722 for nepi van der Tuuk gives 'to the edge; to the coast'. Could it be that in this line aṅdusun means 'to go to the banks [of the Narmadā]'?
22,5c The translation of this line depends on the meaning of goñjoṅ. Van der Tuuk quotes the whole line in KBW 4: 689, but he does not give any explanation. Referring to this place ONW: 180 given goñjoṅ as 'piece of cloth'. However, if goñjoṅ is a kind of clothing, goñjoṅnya meṅas does not seem to make sense, because meṅas usually means 'to turn back' or, for a host of soldiers or animals, 'to flee in the opposite direction; to flee in all directions' (see 10,14b; 50,1 Id). JNW 2: 549 gives, inter alia, pambarep 'the first born; the eldest child' as a synonym of goñjoṅ. Nov, in JNW 2: 678 ve read that babarəp iṅ baris means 'the vanguard of the army', and so lembu goñjoṅ may mean 'the cov(s) used as a vanguard', thus 'leader of the covs'. KBW 4: 789 also gives abaṅ as a synonym of goñjoṅ. So, 'red covs'?
22,5d The presence of camel (ustra) in fourteenth century Java is confirmed by Prapañca in Nag. 59,7d. As Pigeaud has commented, camels were probably
imported from India to be used in Royal processions (JFC 4: 158). For the will.gers who were accustomed only to the sight of covs, buffaloes and goats, the sight of horses, camels and elephants must have filled them with wonder.
22,7c It has been suggested in p. 40, that vvat gantuṅ marga stands for vvat gantuṅ it marga. Grammatically, … n mārga or mārganya would be a better construction (cf. makaran-karaṅ susu instead of makaraṅ karaṅ ṅ susu in 32,10c).
22,7d Although there is hardly any linguistic problem in this line, the significance of the simile: 'lvir ke cap in …' is not clear. If the translation given here is correct, and I cannot see any alternative, this simile indicates that, to a certain degree, a girl enjoyed the freedom of choosing her ovn husband. However, if her parents wished to give her in marriage to another boy (aṅuvahi svāmi?), all she could do was only mutter or 'tut' (kecap) as a sign of her disappointment. Other passages which are of interest regarding relationships between young girls and boys are </p></div>
<div type="canto" n="23">and 31,15d.
22,8c Although 'to turn around' for amaṅsul is not impossible, 'to bark (of deer)' is contextually better; see KBW 3: 635; Sut. 16,5b; cf. pavaṅsil in Wrttasañcaya 93c (see Kern 1875).
22,8d This line is but an echo of Tantri Kāmandaka: 38,17 (see Notes 6,6-7).
22,9c The translation is tentative. Andul is the name of a tree with red campaka-like flowers (JNW 1: 19). Hence the comparison with gisi-gisi, i.e. 'gums'. However, comparison with the teeth of a smiling girl would perhaps (to us?) evoke a better picture, rather than to her 'red gums'.
Although there are no lexical difficulties in the remainder of the line (for aṅalap sor, see Teeuw and others 1969: 311), the interrelationships between aṅasə̄ 'to press onvard', harsa 'delight' (or New Javanese ar sa 'villing'?) and cumbu 'affection' are not clear.
22,9d 'Lotus' no doubt refers to 'blue lotus' or 'vater-lily' which is usually used as a comparison for beautiful eyes (see 12,6a; Ingalls 1965: 164).
22,10c '… lvir leme-lemes i ləməs niṅ teṅah' is a play on vords. The vord ləmes in Old Javanese seems to have several meanings: (1) 'soft; tender'; (2) 'slender; slim (for waist'); (3) 'tendril; young shoot of vine' (e.g. ləmcs iṅ velas-harəp, 37,2d); (4) a kind of silk' (see KBW 3: 773; JNW 2: 148).
22,11b 'The scene was still, with no trace of visitors ..is a favourite cliché to describe a deserted hermitage or desolate place (cf. Teeuw and others 1969: 146). See however Notes 23,4.
22,1 1d-23,1d What types of buildings are represented by raṅkaṅ (22,1 Id), nyāsa (22,12a) and mahanten (23,1c) is not certain (see pp. 53-4; Teeuw and others 1969: 47; for nyāsa see also Notes 25,5d).
23,2c In Sanskrit cāraka means 'spy', but in Old Javanese this vord is normally used to denote 'servant' (see 67,7d; ZA: 301). It is not impossible that the three people mentioned in this line were the servants of the king who came there with the Royal procession, but the expression in 23,2d: tan vidhi niṅ bapênduṅ seems to imply that they were young people from the neighbouring will.ges. There is probably a 'confusion' here between cāraka and caraka. One of the meanings of caraka in Sanskrit is also 'spy', like cāraka, but caraka also includes among its meanings 'wanderer; wandering religious student'.
23,4 So the hermitage which has been described as '… still, with no trace of visitors …' is after all not deserted? Or is the poet describing two different complexes, namely: āsrama (22,11a) and tapovana (23,1a)? This seems to be unlikely for in Old Javanese these two vords are interchangeable (see p. 66).
24,2b-d
There seems to be no doubt about the reading of the manuscripts for '… təkap in aisan …'; nevertheless the correctness of this reading is doubtful, because 'aisan' is metrically impossible. For lack of a better alter-native (dasan or dhasan are orthographically possible, but no such vords are known), I take the reading of the manuscripts: aisan, i.e. 'north-east' (from Sanskrit aisānī; see ONW: 106; sub als any a).
25,3 A small, but interesting, sociological insight: priests came to ask for (aminta) milk, and laymen had to buy (atuku). A normal thing, no doubt, which is why the poet mentioned it almost casually.
25,4d For jaṅgan and tasyan see pp. 65-6.
25,5d Although …i harəp aṅalun-alun ('in the courtyard which was as spacious as the alun-alun yard'), which is the reading of all manuscripts, is possible, i harəp in alun-alun 'in front of the alun-alun yard' seems to be a better reading, (i harcp niṅ alun-alun would be the best reading, but this is metrically impossible). The mentioning of alun-alun in connection with a temple-complex seems rather strange but when a pckən 'market square' is mentioned in 25,6d, and then a comparison to a purasabhā 'palace-court' in 16,Id, alun-alun would not be out of place.
The nyāsa 'building' (where the king had a rest before entering the dharma?) is situated outside the dharma itself, which is evident from Sut. 91,3b-d:
praptên dharma kaboddhan adbhuta ri heṅnya nyāsa gə̄ṅ sobhita / ṅkā tôṅgvan nira yan paṅantya ri datəṅ saṅ srl narendrātmaja
(They came to a marvellous Buddhist dharma, with a great and beautiful building outside; there they halted to vait for the arrival of the prince.)
26,2b The two main temples mentioned here are a Buddhist (26,4b) and a Śivaite one (31,5a). The model for this temple-complex is probably that of Kagənəṅan (see p. 64).
26,3b lurah usually means 'valley; chasm' (ONW: 505; JFC 5: 315). So, 'the valleys of the mountains' for lurah niṅ vukir? However, according to KBW 3: 668 lurah is also a variant of rurah, which means 'region' (KBW 1: 713), so lurah niṅ vukir could mean 'mountainous region' or simply 'moun-tains'. Cf. lurah niṅ jalanidhi (32,4c), which seems to be a Javanese variant of abdhidesa (23,3d).
26,3c Should pinrih sira be amended to pinrih nira? (cf. Notes 8,11a).
26,4a What exactly was a vipra in Tantular's time? In Sanskrit (SED: 972) vipra means 'learned man' (especially in theology), such as: sage, seer, singer, poet,priest. Commenting on Nag. 8,4b Pigeaud (JFC 2: 22; JFC 4: 14-5) asserts that vipra are 'brahmanical Wishnuites', and commenting on Nag. 81,2 he states that they were '… foreigners or of foreign (Indian) extraction and considered by birth the native Javanese clergy's superior' (JFC 4: 259). The first assertion, namely that vipra were Wiṣṇuites, is not completely in accordance with Pigeaud's ovn remark in JFC 4: 9 that in the Nag. 'the vord brahmana is not used' and that 'vipra has taken its place'. Since in Nag. 1,5c (see also Nit. 4,96) vipra is mentioned beside ksatrija, vaisa and sudra to form the well.known division into four castes, there seems to be no reason to doubt that vipra denotes 'brahmin' in general. This is in accordance with the fact that the priest whom the king addresses as vipra in this passage is referred to as mahābrāhmana in 31,5a. Likevise the sage Pulastya, the grandfather of Rāvaṇa, is referred to as vipra (70,1a), mahāvipra (68,5a), brāhmana (72,2c) and mahābrāhmana (72,4a). And this is further corrobo-rated by a passage in Kor: 32,28 which reads: vipra ngaran iṅ saṅ brahmana.
Pigeaud's second contention, namely that vipra were foreigners or of foreign (Indian) extraction, is based on a very weak argument (i.e. Nag. 93,Id?). From the fact that one vipra is said to be of Indian origin, it does not follow that all vipra should come from India, just as the presence of a certain srl Buddhādhitya, a Buddhist monk, in the kraton of Majapahit (Nag. 93,1b), should not be interpreted as indicating that all Buddhist priests were of Indian origin.
The nature of the relationship between vipra and the three religious groups (rsi saiva sogata) is not very clear. Probably vipra is closer to the rsi group than to the Śivaites and Buddhists. In Nag. 10,3a rsi and vipra are men-tioned together, and in Nag. 81,2b vipra is mentioned preceding rsi in the enumeration of the four caturdvija. And in the present kakavin, the sage Pulastya, who was referred to as a vipra and a brahmana, is also referred to as paramarsi (72,1a) and even viprarsi. In fact, according to Kor: 48,7 vipra is one of the three groups which form the rsi (Kaliṅanya … vipra, bhiksu, surūpa, nāma saṅ rsi, mankana pva ya kan sinaṅguh tiga ṅaranya…).
Kern (1919: 182) has suggested that a vipra and a rsi differ only in that the former does not live in a hermitage, whereas the latter does. From the
various data available, it appears that Kern may well be correct and one could perhaps go further and remark that the teachings of the vipra and those of the rsi were probably not greatly dissimilar. This would explain why, although in the religious grouping in those days, three groups, namely the Rsis, the Śivaites and the Buddhists, were usually mentioned (cf. Notes 30,1-2), only the vipra, the Śivaites and the Buddhists had pahoman 'offering-place' in the Royal compound of Majapahit (Nag. 8,4c).
It is remarkable that it was a vipra whom the king asked for an explanation of the meaning of the temple-complex, especially when ve take into account that this temple-complex had a Buddhist and Śivaite temple. The same vipra, in the subsequent cantos, was also to expound the religious teachings and the main tenets of the Arj. to the king. As ve have noted in p. 82, it was in a karsyan establishment that Rājasanagara held the only discussion on religious matters reported in the Nag. Probably the message of the karsyan group was more acceptable to the Javanese nobility of the past than were the teachings of the Śivaite and the Buddhist religious groups.
26,4b Since the vord kusala and dharmakusala both denote 'religious buildings' (see JFC 4: 263; ZS: 350), it is difficult to ascertain vhether boddhadharmākusala is metri causa for boddha-dharmakusala or stands for boddhadharma ṅ kusala (thus ā — a plus v; cf. Teeuw and others 1969: 146).
26,4d Bodhyagrimudrā, i.e. the mudrā of 'the first visdom' is the mudrā of Wairocana (see Lim 1964: 336-7; Soevito-Santoso 1968: Notes 31,10c). It is interesting to note that the variant bodhyasrimudrā which occurs in several manuscripts is very close to one of the three possible Sanskrit equiva-lents for a Japanese mudrā called chi ken-in, namely bodhasrimudrā (Saunders 1960: 102). In fact, Saunders (1960: 235) suggests that instead of bodha- it would be better to read bodhi-. The choice of bodhyagrimudrā is corroboated by the occurrence of this mudrā in the Sut. (32,10c; 139,9b).
27,1-2 This passage contains what was apparently Tantular's fundamental belief. A more sophisticated formulation of this belief also occurs in Tantular's later kakavin, the Sut. (139,4d-6d). This teaching of the oneness of Buddha and Śiva, as formulated by Tantular in the Sut., has been the subject of various papers by numerous scholars, the first of them, and still one of the most important, having been vritten by Kern (VG 4: 149-77) almost a century ago. A (slightly) different translation of the passage of the Sut. from the existing translations (e.g. VG 4; Zoetmulder 1965b; Soevito-Santoso 1968) is given in p. 7. A hypothesis concerning Tantular's religious belief has been proposed in Chapter 6.
27,1a Aksobhya pūrva stands for Aksobhya (r)i pūrva; cf. '… ri daksina' (1b). For this arbitrary use of the locative preposition (i, ri) see Teeuw and others (1969: 147). For a comment on the arbitrary use of honorific titles, such as hyaṅ, sri, for metrical reasons see p. 41.
27,1c The usual name is Mahādeva (cf. Dhatrdeva, Harimūrtideva). The variant reading of F (i.e. Māhadeva) is thus not impossible. It is notevorthy
that in this kakavin Sanskrit Brahmā is often spelled as Brahma (e.g. 1,23a; 1,24a; but also Brahmā, at least once, 43,2b). Could it be that the Javanese vriters at that time had 'corrected' the spellings of proper-names such as Brahma and Maha to Brahma and Maha because they considered such spellings applied to feminine proper-names only?
27,Id Berg (1962: 267) seems to imply that vara-Ratnasambhava (which is Berg's emendation for mar a rakvasambhava occurring in Nag. 16,2d) is the equivalent of Wiṣṇu. In viev of what Tantular says in lines b and d, such a contention is difficult to sustain (cf. JFC 5: 437).
27,2b Or: hyaṅ Buddha rakva kalavan Śiva, rājadeva (i.e. the god Buddha and Śiva, [both are equally] kings of the gods)? Syntactically, such a reading (and its translation) is not impossible. However, as far as I am avare, Buddha has never been directly connected with the gods (deva), and so the appelation 'king of the gods' as applied to Buddha is therefore doubtful.
27,2c It is perhaps of some interest to note that whereas the vord sama 'same' is used in this line (kālih samêka), the vord tungal 'one' is used in Sut. 139,5d (bhinnêka tuṅgal ika). Several possibilities may be proposed here:
(1) The different formulation in the two kakavin is of no significance because whereas in this line Tantular is speaking of Buddha and Śiva (i.e. the individual Deities who are merely manifestations of the Highest Reality), in the corresponding passage of the Sut. the poet is speaking of Jinatva and Śivatatva (i.e. the reality that is Buddha and the reality that is Śiva).
(2) Acceptance of a translation, and an interpretation, proposed by Soevito-Santoso (1968) of bhinneka tungal ika could solve the problem. According to his translation (i.e. 'they are indeed different, but they are of the same kind') tuṅgal 'of the same kind' could be regarded as a synonym of sama 'same; similar'. The question is — putting aside the religious and philosophical problems inherent in the subject matter — vhether tungal can rightly be translated by 'of the same kind'. In New Javanese, tuṅgalé indeed means 'of the same kind' (although tungal, normally also means 'one and the same; to share with another of the same thing'), but it is very doubtful if such usage was common in Old Javanese. As far as Tantular's works are con-cerned, tungal normally means 'one' (see Arj. 1,16d; 18,1c; 40,6a; and except for Sut. 139,5d, Soevito-Santoso too normally translates tungal where it occurs in the Sut. by 'one', e.g. Sut. 48,6a; 53,5b; 96,1c; 134,1a, and even 139,5c).
(3) There was a development in Tantular's religious beliefs. At the time he vrote the Arj. he believed that Buddha and Śiva were sama, in the sense of 'equal', but later, during the decade after finishing the Arj. and the composition of the Sut., he undervent a change of viev and concluded that Buddha and Śiva were not only 'equal', but the two deities were indeed turigal 'one and the same'.
It is not certain vhether saṅ pinakestidharma should be plural (as given in the translation) or singular (thus 'the goal one longs for in the religion'). The meaning of dharma in this expression is also not very clear. It may well refer to religious buildings, i.e. temple-complexes. If this is the case, saṅ pinakesti is here used in the sense of hyaṅ inisti (Nag. 1,1d), which is the Javanese equivalent of istadevatā, that is 'tutelary deity' (see p. 80). The line then may be translated: 'both are the same, they are the tutelary deities of the temple-complexes'.
27,2d The translation is far from certain. There are several problems in this line which cannot be satisfactorily solved:
(1) Is dharma slma a copulative or determinative compound? The former possibility is corroborated in Nag. 79,1a (i.e. dharma mvaṅ slma), and the latter likevise so in Nag. 31,2a (ikaṅ Kalayu dharmaslma).
(2) What is the exact meaning of tuvi yan here? 'moreover', 'even', or simply 'and'?
(3) Accepting dharma slma as a determinative compound, do ve have two establishments (i.e. dharma slma and dharma lepas) or only one (i.e. dharma slma lepas). In the Buṅur inscription (Kern, VG 7: 17-53), Buṅur, which is called a dharma slma in the second part of the inscription, is repeatedly referred to as dharma slma lepas in the first part.
(4) Most manuscripts read: '… yan ləpasādvitiya'. If this long 'a' is not merely a feature of the spelling convention (it is customary to lengthen a vovel which is already long by position, see p. 39) the translation should read: 'in the dharma slma and even in the dharma lepas they are second to none'. Such a reading would imply that in the dharma lepas Buddha and Śiva were normally not 'second to none'.
The reading given in the Text and the translation adopted here suggests the conclusion that the dharma slma is none other than the dharma haji (i.e. Royal dharma) described by the poet in 28,2, after describing the dharma lepas (i.e. free dharma). But then another problem arises, namely, why is it that Kalayu, a dharma slma mentioned in Nag. 31,2a, is not included in the list of the dharma haji in Nag. 73,3-74,1. This seems to imply that dharma slma is not a dharma haji. However, it should be noted that Kalayu is not the only Royal dharma not mentioned in the list, which Prapañca specifically called 'dharma haji vīlaṅ saptaviṅsa' (i.e. 'the tventy-seven Royal dharma"'; see Krom 1919: 296). These temple-complexes were perhaps the most im-portant in those days, but it certainly does not include all the Royal temple-complexes then existing.
28,1-29,2 These five stanzas have been translated by Bosch (1918); a summary of this passage, based on Bosch' translation is included in JFG 4: 244 (see p. 63).
28,1b As far as I am aware, this is the only place where the word bhūdāna 'land-gift' occurs in Old Javanese works. As Pigeaud (JFC 4: 224) has remarked, this is an unusual word (a technical term?). The meaning, however, seems to be beyond doubt.
28,2b Cf. Nag. 73,2d: 'tumusê satus nira heləm' (to pass on to all their descendants in the future).
28,2c It is difficult, in these two lines, to decide whether dharma means (1) law; religious duty, or (2) temple-complex (cf. Notes 27,2c). The translation, therefore, is not certain. In my translation I have taken the former meaning in 28,2d, and the latter in 28,2c. But there is no strong reason why the reverse could not be correct.
29,1a An alternative translation: 'However, this is not the reason why one who fulfils the duty of liberality is loved'. Still another possible alternative is: 'However, such is not the vay one who practices the duty of liberality conducts (de) himself, so that he is loved by the whole vorld' (cf. Bosch' translation).
29,2a sudharmêṅ para is a variant of dharmapara (72,9b). SED: 511 gives dharmapara as 'intent on virtue; pious; righteous' (cf. dharmapārāyana, 31,3d; JFC 5: 367).
29,2b The difference between dāna, atidāna and mahātidāna is described in Skam.: b27-a29. Dāna, according to the Skam., is the first of the sad-paramita, i.e. the Buddhist six transcendental virtues which are the most important if one is to reach Buddha-hood (Skam.: a27: kapaṅguhan i kahyanbuddhan).
29,2d The reading 'mahāvisesa katəmun' is uncertain. In the context katemun must be an arealis form. However, the correct form of passive arealis of anəmu is either katəmva (ka passive) or təmun, in passive. Since the reading 'mahāvisesaka temun' is not likely, the only possible alternative is 'mahāvisesa (ṅ)ka təmun' (cf. Notes 21,4b; see also Teeuw and others 1969: 150, Notes 24,3c).
30,1-2 To support his arguments that a kuti is a Buddhist establishment, van Naerssen (1937: 452-4) has quoted, and discussed, 30,1d-2b. For a dis-cussion on the religious establishments mentioned in this passage, the reader is also referred to Section 5.3.
This passage, 1c-2d in particular, is reminiscent of Rājapatigundala 15a-b (see JFC 1). Several points of interest are discussed here:
(1) Instead of tan kaparahê para (1c) ve read repeatedly in Raj. 15b of tan kavaraha de nin sarat. The former derives from parah 'to approach; to intrude; to attack' (cf. 22,6a; 50,6d) and the latter from avara (Sanskrit āvara?) 'to obstruct; to hinder' (cf. kahavara, 36,1c). The ideas conveyed in these two passages, however, are the same.
(2) The strictly preserved allocation of property according to religious persuasions (1d-2b) is also expounded in Raj. 15b, unfortunately in a somevhat corrupt form. With some emendations (cf. JFC 2: 123), it should read: [saṅ rsi hamūktiha] karsyan, sa [ṅ] yogīsvara hamūk-tiha kabrāhmana[n], (hamūktiha kasevan), saṅ Seva hamūktiha kasevan, saṅ boddha hamūktiha kaboddhan, tan Salah candaka, tan Salah hamūktiha. The following translation is slightly different from that given in JFC 3: 133: 'The rsis are to enjoy the karsyan, the yogis are to enjoy the kabrahmanan, the Śivaites the kasevan and the Buddhist the kaboddhan. No one should commit the sin of taking [possession of] and enjoying [the property of another group]'. That in the Raj. ve have kabrāhmanan in addition to the three religious establishments mentioned in the Arj. is understandable, since vipra (= brāhmana) may be regarded as a separate group (see Notes 26,4a).
(3) The translation of aṅalap by 'to take possession' (JFC 5: 102) is rather uncertain. The vord alap may be regarded as a synonym of candak, which occurs in the abowe passage of the Raj.. However, KBW 1: 289 seems to suggest that in connection with a piece of land aṅalap could mean 'to raise tax'. Thus voṅ aṅalap (e.g. JFC 1: 125) probably denotes 'tax-collector'. Hence an alternative translation for 2a: '… who should be given tasyan and [the right] to raise tax on kalagyan'.
(4) 'to make a mistake in this respect' for salaha para is a too free trans-lation. A more literal rendering would be '… for you to make a mistake in intruding'. But it seems that, in the context of what has been said, the priest meant to say that the king should take care that none of his subjects should trespass on the property of a religious group to which he did not belong. In Raj. 15b ve read: eliṅa kanta nira sovaṅ-sovaṅ, 'one should always remember (i.e. respect?) the borders of each property'.
30,2d The translation of this line depends on the meaning of mahābala. Normally, this vord means 'very poverful', the meaning which I have adopted here. However, if this meaning is given to mahābala, the use of datəṅa in this line is inexplicable. Datəṅa would be easier to explain, if mahabala here could be rendered as 'great army; great soldiers'. And this is not impossible, even though the dictionaries only give 'very poverful', because bala means either 'pover' or 'army'. In this case, the priest seems to be saying that 'if the king has made a mistake in this respect, the curse will affect not only the king himself, but also his great soldiers'.
In viev of the expressions: prāptêṅ mahāvahsa (28,2b) and tekên tus ika (30,3d), there is another possibility, namely that mahabala is metri causa for mahābāla (bāla means 'child' thus 'great descendants'?). If this argument is acceptable then this line may be translated: 'and even your descendant — be careful (i.e. mark my vords?) Your Majesty — will surely fall into distress'.
30,4 This stanza undoubtedly derives from a religious quotation which vas
vell-known at that time, but unfortunately I have not been successful in tracing its origin, nor its occurrence in any other Old Javanese work.
31,Id Nit. 4,6b gives similar advice: mvaṅ devasthana tan vinursita rubuh vaṅunən ika paharja səmbahən ('and you should restore the fallen temples at which the faithful no longer vorship, maintain them and vorship at them').
31,2b Although the general sense of this line seems to be clear, the translation is only tentative. The phrase tan kasalahêṅ vlra is not easy to comprehend, let alone to translate. In translating tan kasalah by 'without exception', I accept Zoetmulder's suggestion (ZS: 239) but this is not wholly satisfactory. Normally, kasalah is the ka passive form of sumalahakən 'to blame' (see Zoetmulder 1950: 49), so it is probably not impossible to translate the line as 'I shall be firm in following these precepts so that I shall not be blamed by the heroes'. However, a similar phrase occurs in Sut. 76,2d: tan kasalahêṅ kavi, which in the context cannot be translated 'be blamed by the poets'. Another possibility is that the vord Salah here refers to salah-para which occurs in 30,2c. The phrase tan kasalahêṅ vlra thus means tan kasalaha-para de niṅ vlra, i.e. 'the heroes will not intrude in the temple-complexes'.
31,2c-d
The reading (and therefore the translation) is not without ambiguity, since much depends on the meaning or klrti and kārya (for their various meanings see JFC 5: 179; 180). This passage is reminiscent of Nag. 82,1b-c. For dhairya 'steadfast; constantly', Nag. 82,1b reads: nora sandeha ri tvas nira 'there is no doubt in his heart'. For maklrtya, Nag. 82,1b has: umulahakən klrti (or klrtya?) 'to work for glory; to win merit', and for manuka ṅ dharma Nag. 82,1c reads: agave (sad) dharmakusala 'to establish dharma'. Only the vord kārya has no equivalent in this passage of the Nag.. Although makīrti is normally used intransitively (cf. akirti, Nag. 17,Id; 29,2b; Siv. 14,Id), it is not uncommon to have a complement for this vord, Siv. 1,1b maklrtya kakavin 'to win the merit of vriting a kakavin', and probably Bhar. 1,6a maklrtya sakakala 'to win the merit of composing a sakakāla' (see Berg 1969: 42). In both examples the meaning of maklrtya could shift to simply 'to compose a literary work'. Hence maklrtya kārya 'to win the merit of doing religious works' may mean 'to perform one's duty (in religious works)'.
31,4a an dāna 'to practice liberality' would be a better choice than an dhana (dhana means 'vealth', and dāna 'liberality; alms-giving'). It is not far-fetched to suggest that the poet used dana for metrical reasons, and that the later copyist(s) mistook it for dhana (cf. adara for adhara in 31,16b).
31,5b It is remarkable that the poet deliberately 'steered' the king avay from the Śivaite temple, simply by using a familar stock-phrase: tan varnan sira. It is clear that Tantular did not wish to describe the Śivaite temple, or to tell hov wonderful was (that is if the vord adbhuta in 5a is not a mere stop-gap; see pp. 40-1) this Śivaite temple. Even if our hypothesis on Tantu-lar's persuasion (see Chapter 6, especially p. 80) is right, there is no doubt that he is closer to Buddhism than to Śivaism.
31,7a-b
An
alternativ
e for 7a is: 'Soon they came to a peerless rest-house which was as beautiful as the palace'. However, in this case tiṅkah-tiṅkah i gopuranya would be an incomplete clause, for it would imply that it is the gopura 'gate' which is compared to vaixuntur. Since vaṅuntur is an open square in the Royal compound (see p. 52), such comparison does not make sense.
31,9b-c;
16b
Not even the reading, still less the translation, of sāmyādijurvā-segəh (9b), slma mvaṅ kuvu nātha (9c) and parasāmyajurvakuvunātha (16b) is certain, due to our still inadequate knowledge of the Old Javanese social structure.
For sāmya, which occurs in the Nag. several times, Pigeaud gives 'commoner' (JFC 5: 277; cf. KBW 3: 349). Such rendering is doubtful. As can be seen from the passages where the vord sāmya occurs in the Nag. and the Ar']., it seems to have been used of a group of people with some significant position. Along with the other State officials they were allowed to enter into the king's presence, when he gave an audience to his subjects. Nag. 41,3b, for instance, says: samasta parasāmya riṅ Kadiri Jaṅgalômarək amuspa rin purasabhā. It is not likely that 'all the commoners of Kadiri and Janggala' came to the audience-hall to pay homage to the king. It is more likely that they were a group of people with some pover in the will.ge communities. This is corroborated by the fact that in many inscriptions para same refers to a group of people who received orders from the ruler who issued the charter.
It is not impossible to regard jurvâsəgəh as a compound, denoting 'people who are in charge of serving food' (cf. juru aṅladosakən, JNW 2: 389; juru bhojakārya 'cook', Sut. 22,6b).
Syntactically in slma mvaṅ kuvu nātha ve may have slmanātha and kuvunātha, or slma, kuvu and nātha. This is due to the fact that the position of mvaṅ and other connective vords in an enumeration of things is not fixed in kakavin. Sometimes it precedes the last thing mentioned in the enumeration (e.g. 31,10b: tumpəṅ səkul mvaṅ hulam), but it not seldom follows the first mentioned in the list (e.g. 31,1 Id: tampo mvaṅ paṅasih kilan). As in many other cases scansion is the paramount consideration in this respect. And so a choice between either one or the other possibility is not easy to make. Slmanātha and kuvunātha are not impossible, for ve have slmapati in at least one Old Javanese work (see JFC 4: 372), and Kuvunātha in Nag. 76,3b (although it refers to a place name). Nevertheless the interpretation 'slma, kuvu and nātha' is probably a better one. Although slma and kuvu normally denote territorial units, these terms are also used to refer to the chiefs of such territories. Thus instead of the more usual form of akuvu for 'kuvu-chief', kuvu in this sense occurs in various kakavin, e.g. Sut. 86,10c: kuvu mvaṅ sāmyâkveh marək; Sut. 118,3c: kuvu juru sāmya kasihan ya; Nag. 40,4d: dapur mvaṅ kuvu juru tumamêṅ sāmya; Nag. 83,5b: mantri sabhumî Java juru kuvu len adhyaksa sarvopapatti. [On the basis of the abowe discussion, Pigeaud's emendation of kuvu juru (Nag. 40,4d) to juru kuvu (see JFC 2: 57) is not acceptable. Neither juru kuvu nor kuvu juru are compounds, but enumerations of things].
The translation 'vaited dutifully' for atuṅgu dharma is no more than
conjecture. Dharma is, again, a problem here (see Notes 27,2c; 28,2c). In the translation I have adopted its primary meaning, i.e. 'lav; religious duty', hence 'dutifully' (via: according to the dharma). However, its second meaning, i.e. 'religious establishment; temple-complex' is also not impossible, 'atuṅgu dharma' may have its literal meaning 'to guard the temple-complexes', and probably is used to refer to persons who are in charge of the supervision of the temple-complexes. They are of high-born families called amātya (see Nag. 74,2: nā taṅ dharma baji… kapvâmātya nipuna taṅ vineh matuṅgva).
Instead of -âdhara, read -âdara 'respectively; humbly' (cf. an dhana for an dāna, Notes 31,4a).
31,1a I assume that ri harep, which normally means 'in front of; before', in this line has the sense of the Sanskrit mukhya 'foremost (among them)'.
31,14a The variant reading of 'y', i.e. vəki, is perhaps better than niki as given in the Text. The phrase veki sə̄k 'chock-full; over abundance' occurs several times in this kakavin (e.g. 24,2a; 31,17c; 38,6b), and this meaning fits well here. In Javanese orthography one can easily make a mistake in vriting vəki for niki. In this case, the line is to be translated: 'No one was absent, the place was chock-full, yet all were filled to repletion …'.
31,14c For the vord balabur occurring in this line ONW: 402 (— KBW 4: 1002) gives 'unseasonal rain, e.g. rain that falls in the dry-season'. So could bras balabur mean 'rice cultivated in the dry-season'? However, JNW 2: 728 lists bəlabur as a synonym for bañjir 'flood' or beleber 'overflov', and KBW 4: 1002-3 gives kagunturan as a synonym for kabalaburan (and guntur is, inter alia, a synonym of bañjir; see KBW 4: 647; JNW 2: 540). JNW says further that bəlabur is normally used in reference to the overfloving or the over-abundance of food. Since this meaning fits the context better than that given in ONW: 402, it is adopted here. Another simile used in connection with the over-abundance of food is guntur-lavan sāgara, i.e. 'flood (or vaves?) and the sea' (e.g. 34,1 Id).
31,15a The reference to piṅit 'seclusion' in this line is rather strange, for in the next stanza (16), ve read that the king distributes gifts to those attending the ceremonial meal. It is more likely that the king would retire to his private quarters only after the distribution of gifts.
For sumalah, JNW 1: 820 gives among other meanings 'to give up pover; to renounce the throne'. Hence my translation '… the responsibility [of commanding the army] was entrusted to …' (cf. sinalahan makəmit in KBW 3: 236).
31,16c Suvastra 'fine clothing' probably refers to kain. This was the gift a king most commonly bestoved on his subjects during a tour in those days (see JFC 4: 78).
32,2a The same temple-complex is described again in Tantular's later kakavin (Sut. 13,1-2). In the Sut. the statue of Gana is said to be situated
under the gate, and that of Wiṣṇu on the north side. This is in accordance with the position of Wiṣṇu in the Śivaite pantheon.
32,2b It is probably better to regard kalasan as a derivative of alas 'jungle' (thus: 'overgrovn by scrubs', so 'neglected') than as a derivative of kalasa 'covered' (cf. ONW: 120).
32,4b Since the temple-complex, of which the restoration is described in the preceding two stanzas, is a Śivaite one, there is nothing unusual in the fact that only kasogatan and karsyan are mentioned in this line.
32,4c For lurah in jalanidhi 'region of the sea; coastal area', see Notes 26,3b.
32,5a The translation '… the sun shines brightly upon the equally bright sea' is probably too free, but the significance of the simile in a more literal translation (i.e. 'the sun shines brightly like the radiance of the sea') is not clear to me.
32,8b Or 'sand' for natar (cf. Notes 34,5b), and so: '…as rain spraying on the sand'?
32,8d ONW: 481 gives malaga as either 'fighter; warrior', which is adopted here, or 'to fight', which is also not impossible (thus: '… ran as if to fight the vaves').
32,9c Although Zoetmulder (ZL: 152-7) has collected numerous passages in which anak-anakan pudak occurs, the exact meaning of this phrase is still difficult to determine. Hence 'to drav pictures on a puppet made of pandanus flowers' is only tentative. However, an alternative translation 'to drav pictures of puppets on petals of pandanus flowers' seems unlikely, since the relation of anak-anakan is closer to pudak than to tika. This is clear from the occur-rence of anak-anakan pudak (Sut. 58,6a; cf. anak-anakan rum niṅ pudak (Sut. 66,4b)), as well as pudak anak-anakan (even: pudak anak-anakan pənuh tika, Ghat. 11,14b; cindagânak-anakan tinulis tikâpənəd, Ghat. 10,9d). The former (i.e. anak-anakan pudak) seems to suggest that the phrase denotes a doll or a puppet made of pandanus flowers, and the latter to suggest a certain kind of pandanus (cf. pandan vvari; see Teeuw and others 1969: 50). In the case of the latter (i.e. pudak anak-anakan), it is interesting to note that in Sanskrit a phrase tarunaketaka 'young pandanus' is also known (see Ingalls 1965: 507).
32,9d I take nya in hajə̄ṅnya as referring to the girl. However, this is not certain. It could refer to tika (thus: 'the beautiful picture she drev') or to anak-anakan pudak (thus: 'the beauty of a doll made of pandanus flowers').
32,10 The translation 'jumping from one rock to another' for makaraṅ-karaṅ (10c) as suggested by Zoetmulder (ZL: 94; see makaraṅ-karaṅ in 32,8c) is
less likely here, since the whole stanza forms an 'extended comparison' (see Teeuw and others 1969: 153, Notes 32,3). In the first line a girl is compared to a sprite, whose beauty is said to be coming from the sea; in the second line her hips are identified with the vaves, in the third her firm, beautiful breasts are identified with the reefs, and in the last line her frightened vhim-pers are identified with thunder. But the comparison does not stop there. In the third line the poet continues by describing hov her lover's 'ship of passion' is vrecked on the 'reefs' of her breasts (for jumahatakəna see Teeuw and others 1969: 153). A similar comparison occurs in Sut. 83,5: 'san līlârja mahākaraṅ susu baṅun dunuṅən iṅ aṅikət pralapita / mombak lvlr i təṅahta dūra n ika tan paṅarəmakəna rāga niṅ rimaṅ' ('your breasts are as graceful and splendid as reefs to be visited by those vriting poetry [karaṅ is a favourite spot for a kavi to vrite his poem; ZL: 91], and your hips are like vaves which will certainly cause the passion of the lovesick to "flounder"').
32,1 1d-13d It is not uncommon to find a dramatis persona in a kakavin composing a short poem usually to express his deep love for his sweetheart before the enjoyment of their love (cf. Zoetmulder 1957: 61-4). In Sanskrit poetics, this kind of mood is called vipralambha-srṅgāra, i.e. 'love-in-separa-tion', which portrays love tinged with grief (see Ingalls 1965: 15).
32,12b The comparison to bhramara 'bee' for the male lover is most ap-propriate, since bhramara also denotes 'lover; paramour'; and is always considered as masculine (see Ingalls 1965: 300).
32,12c Or '… to the shore [sitting] on the back of an elephant rock'? For karaṅ liman see Notes 33,6a-b.
'denta vinava' is an unusual passive construction. Even if ve allow it as a poetic licence for vinava denta, it is still not very common. The more usual form is either vinavanta or kavava denta (see Zoetmulder 1950: 50-2).
32,13a Depending mainly on the meaning of besur (see Notes 21,6d), the translation given here is not certain. An alternative translation is: 'O you, who constantly sent me beautiful poems, hov recalcitrant you are, you have made me many promises, yet have failed to appear'.
33,1a Zoetmulder (ZL: 188) has rightly suggested that paṅhrət is part of a building, though he is not sure exactly which part it refers to. In New Javanese the vord paṅərət is still used to denote 'cross-beams of a roof, abowe the valls and halfvay to the top of the roof' (JNW 1: 427, sub: kərət; cf. KBW 1: 107-8). But the problem is: hov can one vrite a poem on the cross-beams? Surely ve cannot imagine this poor girl climbing the vall to vrite dovn her lamentation on the cross-beams! I have no solution to offer, except to note that in New Javanese there is a metaphor which is reminiscent of this phrase, namely lsvarane nurut usuk' (literally: 'his voice follows the rafters'), to describe a singer's melodious voice. Could it be that 'vriting poems on the cross-beams' is a metaphor for 'vriting beautiful poems'? Be that as it may, it seemed to be commonplace in those days for a poet, or a
would-be-poet, to vrite dovn his lamentation (sambat; also vilāpa or pralāpa) on part of a building which is mostly made of wood (Galestin 1936; see also Notes ll,2c-d). Some of these poems even bear the parab 'pen-name' of the poet (see e.g. Nag. 32,4b-c; cf. JFC 4: 95; Berg 1969: 366).
33,2b Literally: '… blinking repeatedly like the eyebrovs of one smitten with love'.
33,3c The usual meaning of susur 'quid' (ONW: 640; JNW 1: 803) does not make sense here. Probably susur here means 'edge; fringe' as in Malay or Indonesian. Sinusur turut-turutan thus means 'to be edged with stripes' (for turut 'stripes on the clothing materials' see KBW 2: 598). Another possibility is that susur is a variant of New Javanese jujur (cf. susul and jujul, JNW 1: 806), which means 'to baste' (JNW 2: 415; cf. dalujur, JNW 1: 594; dalujur is derived from dujur, and dujur is a variant of jujur; cf. dalan and Malay jalan; udan and Malay hujan). Sinusur turut-turutan thus means 'to be basted with striped materials'.
33,3d This line is of interest from the economic point of viev (see p. 53).
33,6a-b
This realistic description of a karan liman will dispel any doubt that this kind of rock has an appearance of an elephant. We even read in Devaruci 1,6d (see Poerbatjaraka 1940): karaṅ moga katvnalan, kadi esti-vana madyus (a rock suddenly emerged and looked like a bathing elephant); and in Devaruci 1,7c: karaṅ brajagən aruhur, kadi liman anjrum katon (a huge and lofty rock was like an elephant kneeling in the vater).
A similar passage occurs in Sut. 85,1 1c-d: 'lor-vetanya karaṅ liman kinasut in ryak asəmu gərəh iṅ labuh kapat / ghorânəmburakən vvay iṅ tasik avarna maṅuliṅa tuməṅha rin tavaṅ' (To the north-east was an elephant rock beaten by the vaves with a sound like thunder in the fourth season; and the vater was sprayed back into the ocean [from the trunk of this] dreadful elephant rock which looked like [an elephant] looking up at the sky).
33,6c Aṅhañut, the primary meaning of which is 'to drift along the current', is often used in the general sense of 'to perform death rites' (KBW 1: 368; Teeuw and others 1969: 149). However in most cases the relation with the sea or the river (i.e. 'to allow the current to carry along the body') is still obvious. And so ahañutan is to be understood as 'to perform the religious rite of committing suicide by jumping into the sea'. The closest New Javanese equivalent is ṅañut tuvuh (JNW 1: 39), but the vord is used to denote 'to commit suicide' in a more general sense.
33,8d The reading of this line is far from certain. Neither … saka rîri ya ('despondency' for hi see Teeuw 1950: 93) nor sakarîri ya ('all which are left behind'?) are quite satisfactory, and tan bəsur again poses an annoying problem (see Notes 21,6d and 32,13a). Probably tan bəsur refers to the fact that their love has not yet been fulfilled.
34,1c According to the calculations based on the Balinese system, the fifth hour of the day is 1.30 p.m. (i.e. 450 minutes after about 6 a.m.; see Friederich 1959: 154; Teeuw and others 1969: 147, Note 5,4b; Covarrubias 1937: 102). According to Pigeaud's calculation, which is based on the Indian system, it is about 4 p.m. (i.e. 240 minutes after midday; see JFC 4: 63; also JFC 3: 66; 67). There seems to be little doubt that a reckoning based on the Balinese tradition is more satisfactory for calculating the time given in kakavin than one based on the Indian system. This is evident from the fact that, as far as I know, there never occurs in any kakavin a mention of, say, the 10th hour or the 13th hour of the day, which ve would expect if the day (and night) were divided into 30 muhurta as in the Sanskrit system (see Kern 1919: 67; SED: 825). Accordingly, all hypotheses proposed by Pigeaud (JFC 4: 63; 155; 157; 307) concerning auspicious and unpropitious times based on refer-ences to time in the Nag. are highly doubtful.
34,5b The usual meaning of natar 'courtyard' and its other possible meaning, as suggested by Berg (1969: 512), i.e. 'mat', do not seem to make sense here. Contextually, it seems to mean 'the banks' or 'sandbank', probably through 'level; level ground' as in Malay (see datar, MED 1: 167; natar, MED 2: 801).
A similar use of natar occurs in Sut. 90,4: 'Ndak sampun halivat sirê təgal-təgal arata sayojanâlva katəmu /…/ pintən ṅganya huvus kagunturan i mini karana ni natarnya n aṅrəs i suku' ('now they passed through a flat vasteland of a yojana in area …; perhaps flood (or lava?) had passed through here in the past, and so [the sand on] the level ground caused a somevhat painful sensation (New Javanese: ṅəres) to the feet …').
34,5c ONW: 119 ( = KBW 2: 243) lists kalakā for kalakah occurring in this line, and gives 'vater' as its meaning, which, for lack of a better alter-native, has been adopted here. A possible alternative given in JNW 1: 490, i.e. 'bamboo enclosure' (cf. kinalakah in ONW: 119) is less likely; another possibility is that kalakah is a variant of galagah, i.e. 'reed'.
34,7b The translation is conjectural. Literally: 'seen from dovnstream, the illusory images of their movements avoke the passions [of the onlookers]'.
34,7c Referring to this passage, KBW 3: 307 gives sayat as 'broken'. Hov-ever, the significance of the comparison '… like a broken palace', or, as given in the translation here, '… like the palaces cracked' is not at all clear. Nor does any possible alternative give a better picture, e.g. kadhātvan, instead of kadatvan (dhātu: 'substance, element'), and 'many' for sayat, instead of 'broken' (cf. Kor: 140,24: sayat ṅaran v akveh 'sayat means many').
34,10c I take nyū danta 'ivory-palm trees' as the object of amilət 'entvine'. However, if this is so, kalavan nyū danta jaṅgâmilət is a rather forced, unusual structure. In prose it would normally read: kalavan nyxi danta vinilət iṅ jaṅga.
34,10d An alternative reading is to place the comma after tapovana, and so
translate the line: 'On the slope there was [a building] like a hermitage, its tover-like structure was like [that of] a hamlet in a picture'.
35,1a I take asuji here as variant of masuci 'to cleanse; to vash one's self; to bathe' (see JNW 1: 851). Contextually it is better than 'to dress in em-broidered kain (tapih suji)' as suggested by Zætmulder (ZL: 140-1; cf. KBW 3: 301), because in the previous canto, the poet describes the bathing scene in the river. It is also notevorthy that in Sut. 147,10b Z reads asuji and Soevito-Santoso reads asuci.
35,1b Is maṅə̄-maṅen a doubling of anen or two separate vords with more or less the same meaning?
35,1c The alternative translation ('the vater floved sviftly from one rock to another, like vaves just about to break') is syntactically not impossible, and poetically gives a more evocative picture, but since 35,1b-c forms an extended comparison (see Notes 32,10), I consider such translation less likely.
35,2c Is nāgasari masuhun the name of a certain kind of nāgasari flower (Mesua ferrea) or simply 'nāgasari flowers suitable for head decoration'? (səkar suhun is a flower for head decoration; ONW: 640).
35,3d What kind of flower is rājasūnv asusupan (literally: 'a prince with [flower] hairpin')?
35,4a raras nira, literally 'her beauty', refers to the queen (cf. rum nira, 35,5d; rumta, Notes 12,4b).
35,4b asoka is one of the best known flowers in the kakavin. It occurs in almost all kakavin, where nature is described. Asoka sāmaja 'elephant asoka', however, does not occur in other sources, neither is it to be found in the Javanese or Sanskrit dictionaries. It is retained however in Malay as angsoka biram (MED 1: 35). Biram is a synonym of gajah 'elephant'.
36,2c The use of a tadaharsa bird as a comparison for the king is rather strange, because this vord denotes the female of the species, the male being called cucur (see KBW 2: 643; Teeuw and others 1969:147). However, in New Javanese cucur and kedasih (a contraction from tadahasih, which is a synonym of tadaharsa) are no more than synonyms. Kedasih is even considered by some as the male əmprit gantil bird (JNW 1: 522). In New Javanese kedasih, or cucur, is no longer connected with the moon; its voice is considered as ominous of disaster. But in Malay cucur is still known as a night bird, a kind of owl (MED 1: 238), although it is puṅguk (New Javanese kokok-beluk) which is especially connected with the moon. This puṅguk owl is regarded by the Malays as a symbol of hopeless passion; sometimes also of presumption in daring to hope to win the moon (see MED 2: 287). In Old Javanese literature tadahasih and cucur are closer to this Malay puṅguk than to Javanese kedasih and cucur. They are always described as weeping
sorrowfully before the moon has risen (see e.g. Ghat. 12,3b; Arv. 18,1 Id; Siv. 5,1c). The Sanskrit equivalent of this kind of bird is the cakora (red partridge, Pedrix rufa), which is supposed to live only on moonbeams (Ingalls 1965: 272; 499).
36,2d As in Sanskrit literature, the cātaka (crested cuckoo, Cuculus melano-leucas or jacobinus) is always connected with rain. This bird refuses to drink except from rain-clouds. The cātaka is used by the Sanskrit poets as an example of pride, nobility and the tragedy of faith. Usually it represents the poet himself, who cannot live without a generous patron (see Ingalls 1965: 301; 364). Such ideas were probably also common among the Old Javanese poets. Hence cumātaka, i.e. 'to behave like a cātaka bird', is very often used by a kavi at the beginning of his work (see e.g. cumataka in 1,3a). It probably has the meaning of 'to pride himself' (so my translation 'to have the audacity', cf. New Javanese cumantaka, JNW 1: 250), or 'to beg for the favour of a generous patron'.
36,3a Since it is not likely that sekar in this line refers to the posy of fragrant flowers mentioned in 35,4, I take valat səkar as a compound (a synonym of valātkāra, from Sanskrit balātkāra 'by force; vehemently'?) referring to the way the king carried the queen to the golden pavilion (35,5).
36,3b The expression 'apraṅən i luṅid i tuṅtuṅ i halts' is reminiscent of Ram. 12,38:
Nā
halista
malaris ya larasta, mvaṅ matanta taji-tulya tajəm ya, len hidepta mahaləp helaranya, ilā celekta ya upas upamanya
This passage has been translated by Hooykaas (1957: 284) as follows:
Thy eyebrows are as sharp as if they were the bow; the eyes are as sharp as the spurs of fighting cocks; and they reflect the lustre of their feathers; thy cohl can be compared with their poison.
Hooykaas' transliteration of hidep 'eyelash' by hidep 'reflection; thought' might be merely a slip of pen, but it has resulted in a curious mistake in his translation. The following translation differs slightly from that of Hooykaas:
Your finely-shaped eyebrows are your bows;
your spur-like eyes are the arrowheads,
and your splendid eyelashes are the flight-feathers;
as for your collyrium, this is comparable to the arrow's poison.
'malaris' is a synonym of 'luṅid', both mean 'sharp'; as a description for eyebrows, they are similar to New Javanese ñjalirit (JNW 2: 404) and ñjahit (JNW 2: 379), and have the sense of 'finely shaped' (ZL: 176). In this sense, malaris is even used to describe shapely calves (e.g. 21,3d: '… akəter i vetis nirâlaris).
In the metaphor here, halis is thus to be indentified with the bow, in particular the bow of Kama, the Love god (see Ingalls 1965: 164).
36,4d Thus 'inattentiveness; carelessness' for silih? Cf. amrih silih 'to try to outvit'; kasilib 'taken by surprise' (Teeuw and others 1969: 319).
38,5d
'The vater sprang from the moon' is in accordance with the Indian idea that the moon is 'the vessel of divine ambrosia drunk by ancestors and gods yet ever filled again'. The sphere of the Moon is the reservoir of rain vater. As such, the Moon is the lord of plants, the deity protecting all vege-table life (see Daniélou 1963: 98-100).
38,7a '… and what they said came to the ears of the queen' is, admittedly, too free and too conjectural a translation, but contextually a better translation would be hard to propose. The difficulty lies in the unintelligible expression: təka hirəṅ ('come black'?). For the abowe translation I read hirin (a synonym of samlpa which may be translated by 'presence') instead of hiren. But this is only a very slight possibility, because orthographically ri and re are very different letters. Orthographically təkahirəṅ is very close to təkapirəṅ. In New Javanese kapircṅ means 'to be heard', but it is doubtful vhether this form existed in Old Javanese. In any case the element tə- would be inexplicable. If none of the abowe suggestions is possible, probably we have to take the reading of y, that is təka marək, and this line is therefore to be translated: 'they told this to the king, and then they came to the presence of the queen'.
38,9a I take vibhu 'poverful' (ONW: 540) in its primary meaning, i.e. 'far-extending; all-pervading' (SED: 978). In this sense it perhaps has a similar meaning to trivikrama as it occurs in various Old Javanese works. In Sanskrit literature trivikrama is a special form of Wiṣṇu, that is when he encompasses the three vorlds. In ancient Java this connection with Wiṣṇu was no doubt still known, as it is clear from Bhar. 8,1 on the occasion when Krsna shovs that he is an incarnation of Wiṣṇu (mintonakən krama nira n tuhu Wiṣṇumurti / līlātrivikrama makāvak ikaṅ triloka). In many other kakavin, including Tantular's, however, trivikrama is often used without any connection with Wiṣṇu vhatsoever (e.g. 39,1a; 62,1a). As in New Javanese (see JNW 1: 661, sub: tivikrama), trivikrama simply means 'a huge, expansive body which is assumed by a mighty person to show his great super-natural pover'. In this meaning, trivikrama may be regarded as no more than a synonym of vibhū (see also Notes 62,1a-b).
39,9d Based on the information from KBW 1: 144, it is possible to regard aksaya as a modified form of saṅs ay a 'anxiety', and niraksaya would therefore mean 'without any anxiety'. Another alternative reading '… tan gumirisina nirâksayêṅ manah' is less likely, firstly because gumirisina nira is an impossible form (gumirisin is an intransitive verb; to be used transitively it needs a preposition, e.g. 14,2d: gumirisin i saṅ mahâsura), and secondly because the usual meaning of aksaya 'undecaying' (SED: 3) does not fit the context.
38,10d
As Pigeaud has noted in JFC 4: 194-5, the original Indian meaning of caturāsrama, i.e. the four stages of human life (brahmācari, grhastha, vānaprastha and bhiksuka) was also known in the Majapahit Court. This is evident from the occurrence of this technical term in OJO 79 and OJO 83. However Pigeaud maintains that the caturāsrama mentioned several times in the Nag. does not refer to this original meaning, but it is used to denote 'a collective name (associated with the ancient quadripartite classification) for certain religious communities connected with the common people and country life'. In the context of this episode, neither of these meanings fit. The fact that the mention of caturāsrama in this passage refers to the performers of the trivikrama ceremony indicates that this group was highly esteemed by the king. This is not likely if caturāsrama included people who were still in the brahmacāri or grhastha stages, let alone if it referred to 'certain religious communities connected with the common people and country life'. Nov, in KBW 1: 619 we read of a caturāsrami serving as a collective name for the brāhmana, rsi, saiva and sogata, and thus as a synonym for caturdvija which has been discussed in Notes 26,4a. This interpretation seems to be the most appropriate, at least in this context.
39.4 Some of the devices for catching fish mentioned in this stanza are already listed in the ONW, namely: variṅ, pəcak, karakad (under karakah) and jala, all of which are some kind of net. Of the other devices: añco is a square net (JNW 1: 10); ser is a landing net or bamboo sieve for fishing in shallow vater (JNW 1: 755; 1: 803, sub seser); susug is a kind of trap or basket made of bamboo (JNW 1: 807; cf. Zoetmulder 1958: 19,10 surpa pva ṅaran in susug 'sūrpa (vinnoving basket) is the name of susug'); laba is some kind of trellis-work made of thin bamboo strips used for fencing off part of the river or sea so that fish can be caught easily (JNW 2: 78-9); pacikur is not listed in JNW, but KBW 4: 47 lists this vord as the name of some kind of fishing-tackle. The mentioning of palva 'boat; ship' in 4d is strange, to say the least, for Tantular has not referred to the existance of any kind of boat in the river before. And the occurrence of ati 'very' preceding palva makes it most likely that we should have an adjective, or even a verb (cf. Teeuw and others 1969: 312) instead of a noun. And so instead of atipalva I read ati malva, i.e. 'very large'.
39.5 Most of the fishes enumerated in this stanza have been listed in the ONW. Of those unlisted in this Old Javanese dictionary, sumbilaṅ is a kind of sea-fish with a poisonous sting (JNW 1: 875), pe is a kind of ray (JNW 2: 170); totok is a kind of sea-shell (JNW 1: 651); lajar is listed in KBW 3: 747, and vadukan in KBW 3: 527 (which refers to New Javanese dukaṅ (see JNW 2: 353) and Malay badukaṅ (see MED 1: 99), that is 'catfish').
40,2a Makara 'vater-elephant' and caviri 'monster-head' (its variant is cavintən; see however JFC 2: 54) are usual figures in a temple (see Teeuw and others 1969: 48: 312).
40,3a Since in this stanza the members of the family of the god are mentioned, ləmbu suddha 'white bull' here refers to Nandi, the vehicle of Śiva, which is 'white as snow, with a huge body and soft brown eyes' (Daniélou 1963: 219-20).
40,3d Saisuka is not known in the Sanskrit dictionaries. The vord is related to sisu, which primarily means 'child, infant', and is also known as one of the names of Skandha or Kumara, who was one of the sons of Śiva (SED: 1076).
40,4a-b Badava
ṅ
-nala
'Fire-emanating Turtle' and Urāgarāja 'king of serpents', who is also called Ananta-bhoga, are known in Old Javanese cosmogony as the base and the foundation of the vorld, and the island of Java in particular. Hence the mention of dasar i vəkas Hi mahltala in 4c. For a very thorough discussion on Badavaṅ-nala see Hooykaas 1964: 103-17 (in which he quotes and translates 4a); see also Svellengrebel 1936: 296-7.
40,5b 'to vear' for an go would not be posible, for the form should be akan go. So I take aṅgo as a nasalised form of go, which is the root of gogo 'groping in the vater' (see KBW 4: 807; JNW 2: 626, sub: gogo).
40,5c For galigiran, JNW 2: 627 (under gigir) gives: iṅkaṅ taksih vətah 'which is still intact'. Olər-oləran probably also has the same meaning. The base vord is ulər, which, among others, is used as a classifier for banana. … pisan arəjôlər-oləran, thus literally means 'beautiful bananas of many ulər'.
40,7a arəmuk means 'crushed'. Is this to be understood as 'to strike pearls on stones to test their quality'?
40,3d Cf. Covarrubias 1937: 116: '…Often the favourite bathing-place is a shallow spot in the river where men on one side, women on the other, squat on the vater … scrubbing themselves with pumice-stone that removes superfluous hair and invigorates the skin, or rubbing their backs with a rough stick or against a large stone placed there for the purpose', [italics are mine].
40,11c Or: 'his numerous arms were like trees on a slope, and the arms which fondled her resembled shoots of the gaduṅ vines'?
41,Id The simile 'rivals the lightning issuing from the moon' is probably developed from the belief that the rain comes from the moon (see Notes 38,5d).
41,2b Literally: 'your waist is like vaves which will vreck the passion of the onlookers'. For the meaning of aṅjahatakəna see Notes 32,10.
41,2d amutər 'to churn' refers to the samudramanthana episode 'the churning of the ocean', narrated in Adip.: 31-4. In this episode it is told that when the ocean was churned by the gods and the demons, the goddesses Sri and Laksmī sprang from the vaves. The goddess Sri is the goddess of beauty (see Daniélou 1964: 261), hence the expression putus niṅ lituhajə̄ṅ 'the topmost of beauty' in 2c.
41,4a-d rumta
your beauty' in 4a and 4d are both used to denote second persons, the former for the queen, the latter for the king (see Notes 12,4b).
41,6d Although this line is structurally closer to 6c (and thus refers to the demon soldiers) than to 6b, I take this clause as dependent on the vord liṅga (6b), which is in accordance with the reading in the OJ Utt. (Zoetmulder 1958: 25,21 '… kāñcanaliṅgapratima inilvakən saparan ikaṅ Rāvaṇa'.
41,7c Poerbatjaraka (1933: 26) reads tegal ayun, which occurs in Nit. 1,10d as təgal ayū n, and considers tegal ayū stands for təgal layū (cf. VG 9: 24). Since ayun is a common vord for 'battle', and tegal papraṅan 'battlefield' occurs several times in this kakavin (51,6a; 57,6d; see pp. 60-1), I take the correct reading of this vord to be tegal ayun, i.e. 'uncultivated land suitable for use as a battlefield'.
42,6b Or: sinivî Magadha sakala, i.e. 'ruled throughout the kingdom of Magadha' ?
43,1c For the punctuation '… lagana kunan, mon ikaṅ …' instead of '… lagana, kunaṅ mon ikaṅ ..see Notes 1,21b.
43,Id For niscita, SED: 561 gives, among other meanings, 'one who has come to a conclusion, or formed a certain opinion; … certainty'. This line is thus literally to be translated: 'It is not certain, I am sure, that I would be slain ..
44,3b Since atigas can only be either intransitive or reflexive, i.e. 'to cut off one's ovn head', paratrâtigas can only mean 'to commit suicide'. The signi-ficance of the simile (i.e. 'as useless as the death of a medicine-man committing suicide') is not clear to me. For a description of a Balinese bahan, which no doubt is the spiritual descendant of the Old Javanese valyan, see Covarrubias 1937: 349 sqq.
44,4b 'arrogant' for vruh-vruh is no more than conjecture (cf. 70,3b). Mahâsura is used here in the second person, and musuh refers to Arjuna.
44,4c-d The episode referred to by the poet in this passage is the Adip.: 44, in which Wiṣṇu asked Garuda to be his mount.
45,7d The reading pva ta n (as emphatic particle) is admittedly unusual. If we take the more common reading of pva tan, the line may be translated: 'I am certain that Arjuna will not be able to kill me in battle'.
45,9b The translation 'chariot of my chariot' implies that vimāna vimāna ni ṅvaṅ stands for vimāna ni vimāna ni ṅvaṅ. But even if this is the case, the phrase is still ambiguous. Kern (1919: 63) has noted that a form such as peka niṅ peka, found in Nag. 18,1c, is an idiom denoting 'a number of servants'. On the other hand, Poerbatjaraka (1924: 222) argues that such an
expression would mean 'servants of servants', which is adopted here. If Kern's suggestion is right here, this line is to be translated 'and so he is just like [one of] my chariots'. However, since Rāvaṇa is known to have had one vimāna par excellence, namely the Puspaka (see 10,7), such a translation is less likely than the one suggested here.
45,12a 'paran in hrdayâtiguhya' is literally: 'the goal of my heart which is most secret'.
46,1b This line is reminiscent of Tap. 103,16 sqq. (see Notes 6,1c).
46,5a Does 'the monkey-field' refer to a təgal inhabited by monkeys or one merely frequented by them? Another possibility is that pravaga is not derived from Sanskrit plavaga 'monkey', as given in ONW: 389, but is a variant of vaga (cf. pralambaṅ - lambaṅ; prasətya - sətya in New Javanese). According to JNW 2: 69 vaga (which is derived from Sanskrit bhaga) is a synonym of pavadonan, that is 'vulva'. Nov, the krama vord of pavadonan, i.e. paestren also means a type of cultivated təgal, usually near a river (cf. JNW 1: 94). A similar expression is alas vadon 'female forest', which is used to denote 'thicket' as against the alas lanaṅ 'male forest' to denote 'great forest' (JNW 2: 81, sub: lanaṅ).
46,7b In Old Javanese parva is used as a technical term referring to a prose work with epic contents (Ensink 1967: 1).
46,9b For sasadhara mapalih see Notes 3,6c-d.
46,11c As malaga can also mean 'fighter; warrior' (ONW: 491), instead of vlra suyasa malaga, the phrase may be read vlrasuyasamalaga, i.e. 'bold, famous warriors'.
47,3a The reading of F, 'vimānânila' instead of vimānâkila, is not impossible. In this case this line is to be translated: '… circled over the Hehayas in his celestial chariot which flev like the vind', which is an appropriate description for the chariot Puspaka. On the other hand the phrase vimānâkila is not unknown from other sources, e.g. Bhom. 96,13.
47,4c bhinna il kena is literally 'those affected were destroyed'.
48,1c What is the function of da in huniṅan da? Does it stand for nda, an emphatic particle, or is it to be read huniṅanta?
49,1a It is interesting to note that in the lakon (vayang repertoire), Su-mantri is the childhood name of Suvandha.
49,6c The reading '… asva dvīpa len turaṅga', i.e. 'horses, elephant and horses' is not certain. Probably this line should read: mevivv aṅasv (or aṅ asv?) advlpa len turaṅga, i.e. 'thousands of them attacked on their elephants and horses'.
49,13d hampru is 'bile' (JNW 1: 168), but, like pyah which means 'liver' (or 'heart') as well as 'stomach' (KBW 4: 23), in Old Javanese it probably also denotes 'stomach'.
50,10b '… amran tulalay ika tugəl…' is syntactically rather forced. Probably it stands for 'amraṅ ṅ tulalay, ika tugəl', or 'amraṅ tulalay nika, tugəl'. The meaning, however, is quite clear.
50,12b There is no doubt that 'falling diamonds' for hlrapata is lexically correct, but in the context it does not seem to fit well. This implies that either the parvatâstra is to be understood as 'mountain of diamond veapons', or that kira in Old Javanese might have the meaning of 'rock; stone'.
51,4b 'Mārīcêki pəjah de Kaliṅgapati …' would be grammatically better (cf. 51,4a: … pəjah de Sūryaketu), but it is metrically impossible.
51,5b '… trees entwined by vines' is conjectural, but vvit iṅ taru lata 'trees of vine trees' is a strange expression, unless it is to be understood as 'trees to support the vines'.
51,12b The seventh month of the Javanese calendar ( = Māgha in Sanskrit) coincides with the months of January-February (JFC 5: 24). This is the month when the rain falls heavily and daily in Java, so that according to folk-etymology 'Januari' is derived from lhujan sehari-hari', that is 'rain daily'.
52,5b I take paṅlampū as the equivalent of Malay terlampau, i.e. 'excessively; too bad!' (cf. KBW 3: 722; Berg 1969: 444). However, paṅlampū may also be regarded as an imperative form (see Zoetmulder 1950: 168) of aṅlampū 'to go on; to carry on', and therefore it is not possible to translate this line by 'now come on, you vorthless king …'.
52,6a KBW 4: 505 quotes this passage, but gives no comment. The trans-lation of maṅadu mindê narapati 'to strike the king's heads one against the other' is conjectural, but in the context seems appropriate. The literal trans-lation, i.e. 'to make the goats fight the king' is unintelligible. Another possible literal translation is 'to make the two kings fight as goats'. It is on this possibility that I base my translation 'to strike the king's heads one against the other', since this is hov goats fight.
53,1-4 In this canto, through the mouth of the first minister of Mahispati, the poet expounds the ranayajña 'battle-sacrifice', which is a favourite theme for Sanskrit as well as Old Javanese poets (see Zoetmulder 1957: 58; Teeuw and others 1969: 150). Tantular himself again alludes to this sacrifice in Sut. 114,2.
54,1-55,1 There is no doubt that samaratha (54,1c), ardharatha (54,3a), atiratha (54,3b) and mahāratha (55,1b), referring to different persons as they do, denote certain ranks in the heroes' hierarchy, but the relative status
of these ranks is not clear. In fact, with the exception of mahāratha 'great warrior', these vords do not appear in the dictionaries. The degrees of the respective heroes are indicated by sama 'common', ardha 'half; semi', ati 'very', and maha 'great'.
54,Id An alternative translation: 'calmly he performed the sacrifice on the battlefield, recited incantations, and was willing to die at the hands of the demon king'.
57,3a maṅsulakən normally means 'to return' (transitive verb), but 'to return the king', or even 'to return to the king', does not fit the context. Probably this vord is the equivalent of New Javanese mbalik (vaṅsul is the krama form of bali; and balik is a variant of bali) i.e. 'to go over to the enemy's side', or Malay membelakangi 'to turn one's back'.
57,4a The stroke of two is 9 p.m. (see Notes 34,1c).
57,6b nrpati rāja rāja is a rather curious phrase. Is nrpati different from raja? Or is one of the two no more than a stop-gap?
57,7b It is very unlikely that surasena here means 'the host of the gods' as in 7,3b, because there is no mention in the present kakavin, nor in any other source that I know of, that Arjuna Sahasrabāhu had an army of gods at his command. Probably the name is derived from Sanskrit Sūrasena, who is known as one of the sons of Kārtavīrya (SED: 1086). For metrical purposes, it was changed to Surasena, and eventually became Surasena (cf. dāna - dhana; Notes 31,4a).
57,8b The usual meaning of mihat, i.e. 'to look at' does not fit the context, because the simile 'like a lion wishing to see an elephant' is not strong enough in the context. There seems to be a shift of meaning in this vord: to see - to look at - to face - to oppose (e.g. 58,Id) - to do battle. In this simile, Arjuna is compared to the lion and Rāvaṇa to the elephant, and this comparison implies that Arjuna is superior to Rāvaṇa (thus Ingalls 1965: 300: 'It is proverbial that the lion kills the elephant in combat … and the poets are prone to laugh at the elephant for his Dutch courage when faced with the lion').
57,8c It is notevorthy that the phrase tan pasaṅkan inucap (literally: not because he is mentioned) occurs tvice in the present kakavin (see 67,8a), on both occasions referring to divine sages, who apparently do not live in this vorld.
58,5 This passage contains the prophecy of the death of Rāvaṇa at the hand of Rāma with the help of Sugriva, the king of the monkeys, as narrated in the Rāma stories.
59,2c-d
An alternative reading is '… mvaṅ bhaktya niṅ rat kabeh ṅkānê jə̄ṅ nira Rudramūrti, …' ('besides the devotion of the people to the feet of
the god Rudramūrti'). However, this is less likely, since the following clause, i.e. kahidəp saṅ maṅkana lvir nira would be an incomplete one.
59,8d '… become ocean and mountain .. is to be understood as 'sea of blood and mountain of corpses', which is a common stock-phrase to describe the great casualties among the combatants (see e.g. 17,7b: ṅ lvaṅ baṅun parvata sava, rudhirâdres banun sagarâlva; 50,1b; 6,12a-b).
60,2d jalanidhi matsya is to be understood as 'ri jalanidhi matsya …' (cf. suku niṅ gunuṅ for ri suku niṅ gunuṅ; Teeuw and others 1969: 146). This interpretation is, I believe, better than regarding the phrase as a Sanskrit compound (i.e. 'sea-fish') because nya in varinya refers to the sea. kadi pāvakôsnâṅalun is literally 'like raging hot fire'.
61,4d
The reading '… puh mar an ..is better than 'puh mara ṅ' (with mar a as an emphatic particle), for mar occurs several times denoting 'weak; poverless; exhausted' (c.f. 60,5d: mar puh tiba).
62,
1a-b The comparison with the god Tripurântaka 'the destroyer of the Triple city', i.e. Śiva, when the king assumed his trivikrama form, clearly indicates that to the poet trivikrama is no longer regarded as the special form of Wiṣṇu (cf. Notes 38,8a).
62,4a '… mihat n ton …' is a curious phrase, since both verbs have the meaning of 'to see; to look at'. In the translation only one of the two appears. However, it is probably not too far-fetched to render mihat as 'to appear; be visible', comparable in sense to Indonesian 'nampah'. If this is the case, the line may be translated: 'Dasavaktra was enraged, and he appeared furious at the sight of …'.
63,3 d 'tinaṅgəh kədo' is literally 'has been varned, but was stubborn'.
63,5d kinehan (from keh) is an unusual vord. In Old Javanese instead of keh, kveh is usually used. In the sense in which it is used here (i.e. 'to be done by many people together'), however, kinabehan (from kabeh) is more usual (see ONW: 113).
63,8 In </p></div>
<div type="canto" n="63">we find the most significant difference between the Balinese and the Javanese versions of the present kakavin. In the Javanese version (y), </p></div>
<div type="canto" n="63">ends with 63,7 and then begins with a nev canto which has no counterpart in the Balinese version. Thus instead of two stanzas (i.e. 8 and 9), y has two cantos of 14 stanzas. Considering the unreliability of the reading of y, there seems to be little doubt that two cantos have been inter-polated into the Javanese version, rather than that the Balinese version has lost two cantos. Such being the case, I put this interpolated passage in the Variae Lectiones, rather than in the body of the Text. The problem of interpolation in Old Javanese works, the OJ Ram. in particular, has been discussed by Hooykaas (1955), and it would be too far from the scope of
the present Notes to the Translation to discuss it here. The following remarks are made, nevertheless, because they are relevant to the editing of this interpolated passage:
(1) The interpolator still had a mastery of rules of metre, long forgotten by the Javanese (cf. Poerbatjaraka 1926: 5). This is evident from the correct scansion of every line throughout the interpolation. Several long syllables seem to be forced, e.g. pvā, māti, ṅūni, but as we have noted in pp. 38-9 this feature is not at all unusual in the present kakavin, or in any other kakavin.
(2) The language is still passable as Old Javanese. There are, to be sure, some signs of possible 'neologisms', such as valiṅ ira instead of valiṅ nira, nuṅsuṅa instead of manuṅsuṅa (see B,4c and 63,8b), but such forms are not uncommon in many Old Javanese works. The omission of the connective particle 'n' in a possessive construction is not rare in this kakavin and the same vord nunsuṅ occurs even in a tvelfth century poem (Har. 27,4c).
It is thus not easy to prove that this passage is an interpolation, apart from the fact that it occurs only in the Javanese manuscripts. Nevertheless, the following arguments may, perhaps, be used to support this contention:
(1) In this passage the name Sukhasārana is used to denote only one demon (A,Id) as in the New Javanese version of this story, whereas in the other parts of this kakavin, it appears to indicate two demons (see Notes 7,6b) as in Sanskrit literature.
(2) In A,7c-d we read that the king and the queen will return to the vorld of Wiṣṇu: Arjuna will assume his form as Wiṣṇu, and Citravatī as the goddess Sri. In the other part of this kakavin Arjuna says that he will return to the abode of Śiva (72,Id). And Tantular indeed compares Arjuna more often to Śiva than to Wiṣṇu. In the New Javanese version, however, Arjuna is regarded as an incarnation of the god Wiṣṇu, and his wife as an incarnation of the goddess Sri.
The contents of the passage themselves are not important to the sequence of the narrative, for they are only a 'repetition' of what will be told in </p></div>
<div type="canto" n="64"> However, for the sake of completeness this passage is presented and translated in this edition in full. Since it is almost impossible to reconstruct a definite Text based on the readings of the Javanese manuscripts (see Section 7.3) the text included in the Variae Lectiones and the translation offered below are only tentative:
(Canto A)
1 Let us tell no more of what happened to Daśāsya after he was captured by the king of kings; we tell now of queen Citravati, who was left on the bank of the Narmadā. A demon came bringing her nevs that the king had fallen in battle. This vicked demon was called Sukhasārana, and had disguised himself as a virtuous man.
2 And so [all the women of] the court cried aloud like the sound of the
vaves of the sea,
and the queen, foremost among them, was perplexed, speechless and sorrowful;
she was dazed, languorous, trembling, exhausted and looked as if drained of life.
Then she fainted, and no longer heard the lamentations of the servants and nurses who came to her aid.
3 Soon after she revived, she decided to go to the place where the king had
fallen in battle;
but the demon stopped her, telling her of the approach of the demon king who was going to carry her off — thus spoke the demon, pretending to be
truthful and faithful. And so the queen cut her hair and nails
4 to be placed at the feet of the ruler of the Hehayas.
Such were her instructions to her servant who was sent to the battlefield. Thereupon the queen at once rose and prepared to follow [the death of] her husband,
for she had no desire to live on; she unloosened her hair, and took a sharp gleaming dagger in her hand, [saying]:
5 'O my king, O my belowed one, please take heed of my lamentations for
you,
you, who like the god Harimūrti in battle, are feared by all daitya, yaksa and asura,
who are the god of the flower garden descended to the earth so that
I could serve you [read: kahadəp?] in the fragrant bed-chamber, for all impurities are cleansed from the body when one sleeps under one coverlet with you.
6 now you have been slain by a vicked, arrogant demon,
although not because of his might, but because of your wish to fly [to
heaven] and to leave your body. In short, my Lord, I wish to join you
in heaven — this certainly is my wish — or wherever else you go.
7 O my dearest, please awake, and let us vanish together to the sky,
to be greeted by the eagle, the great mount of heroes who fall in battle, and together we will wander over the three vorlds at ease and live happily
in the splendid, magnificent vorld of Wiṣṇu; you will assume your beautiful form of the god Wiṣṇu, and I that of Sri, the great goddess.'
8 Thus she spoke, then with her gleaming dagger she quickly stabbed herself in the heart, and her blood spurted high, gushing beautifully in
a sparkling bright colour. Then the queen did homage to the sani (?),
vhile vashing her face with the blood, which was like flowers strevn on her hair and breast.
9 She was in deep meditation, performing the sunyayoga (i.e. the yoga to reach the Void?),
and had concentrated her mind on the 'three-minds' as taught by the perfect yogi.
And so she died; the jewels (?) quickly and beautifully followed (?) flower petals suddenly rained dovn at the same time, as though falling from the sky.
(Canto B)
1 On the death of the queen who now lay on the floor (?) of the blooming
asoka flowers,
all the beauties of nature around the banks of the Narmadā looked dazed and perplexed:
the ivory bamboos stripped off their sheats and sighed pitifully;
the thunder rumbled softly as though weeping painfully and sorrowfully;
2 the sun was dimmed by clouds, a rainbow formed in the sky, and light
rain drizzled upon the mountains, and the [brilliance of] lightning that brightened the darkness looked
subdued (?) because of the queen's death. Moreover, all the maidens of the court followed the queen in performing the act of bela,
foremost among them were those who shared the king's love with the queen, they fell at her feet.
3 At the sight of what happened [the servant who had been sent to the king
by the queen?] would gladly have joined [those who performed bela], and therfore she quickly departed to pay homage [metri causa for seva?] to the king['s body] and then join
in death those she loved. Let us not tell of her journey; we now tell of king Kārtavīrya [according to the metre: Krtavīrya!], who returned [to the bank of the Narmadā], accompanied by the dreadful warriors of the Hehayas with their possessions and chariots.
4 He followed the same route through the impassable wooded mountains, and soon reached the bank of the Narmadā, where the queen was lying
dead.
Before he set out to var he had told her [that on his return] he would like
her to velcome him with loving eyes, but now he found she was no longer as he had left her: she was dead, her appearance was pitiful and pale.
5 The young and old servants, nurses, albinos, hunch-backs, the kuñja vere
all lying dead.
And so the king was amazed and speechless at the sight of the dead, and all the officers were struck dumb.
Then came to the king's presence the servant sent by the dead queen, saying:
64,2a-b
An
alternative reading: 'Ya hetu nira yan ta mar kapati…'. The translation of '… tan vriṅ ulaha ruməṅə̄ naresvara / ulih niṅ atuluṅ …' is far from certain, but a better alternative is difficult to suggest.
64,3c It is not easy to decide vhether the vord viphala 'useless; of no avail' refers to the deed of the queen, or to the victory of the king. Contextually, both readings are possible. If the latter is correct, this line is to be translated: 'And so, although you survive and are victorious, this is of no purpose'.
65,2c The translation is tentative. I take manis-manista 'your sweetness' simply as a synonym of 'rumta', which, as we have seen in Notes 12,4b, is used as a term of endearment for the belowed one. Kvan could mean either 'command' or 'place' (Teeuw 1946: 82), and although Zoetmulder favours the latter, which I have adopted here, as the appropriate meaning (see ZA: 297), the translation 'command' (thus: 'where is your command', i.e. 'Com-mand me …') contextually is not impossible. Another reading: ndl kukvān i manis-manista (taking kukvān as a derivative of kuku 'nail', thus 'scratching') is likevise not impossible. Scratching with sharp nails and biting with teeth are standard practice in sexual enjoyment as described in Sanskrit literature, and nail wounds were borne with pride, and even became a criterion for social distinction (see Ingalls 1965: 200).
The second part of the line is even more uncertain. I assume avijāṅdələ̄ stands for avijaṅ and aṅdələ̄, which admittedly is a very weak assumption, hence the translation 'fi am] lying on your breast and looking into (?) your eyes'.
65,3d lsapudaka salambaṅ in lanə̄' (salambaṅêṅ lanə̄ is probably better; cf. Teeuw and others 1969: 315) is an expression indicating the wish to be always together. People used to vrite lambaṅ 'poems' on the petals of pudak flowers (see e.g. 74,5: akirim kakavin i dala niṅ pudak sumar; see also Notes 12,7d).
66,2a Literally: 'For it is not the arrival of the [real] death, the death of the queen who was the jewel of the palace'.
66,2c In this passage, the Old Javanese text could give the impression that Sukhasārana is the name of a single demon, as in the New Javanese lakon (cf. Notes 63,8). However, from a passage describing the fight between Rāvaṇa's army and that of Waiśravaṇa, we have strong reason to argue that Tantular is cognizant of the fact that Sukhasārana is a copulative compound representing the names of two demons, i.e. Sukha and Sārana (Sanskrit: Suka and Sārana; see Notes 7,6b).
66,4d For 'himpər manure manik' see Notes 21,6b.
67,2a The exact meaning of sariravāhya ('physical body'?) in this line is not at all clear. Probably, the following clause (i.e. 'baṅun …') is a Javanese rendering for a phrase the author has assumed to be Sanskrit.
67,2d yak pəjaha ('I shall die') does not fit the context, for after the queen had been revived, there is no reason why the king should have had any wish to die. Probably it should be read yat pəjaha (which graphologically is not impossible, the letter't' being rather similar to 'k'), i.e. 'if you had really died'.
68,3c Is anlaga a verb ('to fight', thus literally: 'by you, who fought most valiantly'), or can it also be a noun ('fighter', thus: 'by you, the most valiant fighter')? Cf. malaga, Notes 32,8d.
69,1c An alternative reading is: apituvi tan pabhoja, bañu dūra hana n masuṅa ('moreover he had no food, and it was not likely that anyone had given him vater'). However, since ma-bhoja-bañu is analogous to New Java-nese manan-ṅinum or Indonesian makan minum, I prefer to read the text as a ma- form of the compound bhoja-bañu.
70,1b The reading maṅgəh n ūnin which is adopted here is not certain. In this reading I take ūnin as a passive arealis form of Tini. Another alternative reading is maṅgəh ṅ ūni n ('his vords were firm …'), and although maṅgəh ṅūni n ('he was firm before …') is not an impossible reading, contextually it is less acceptable.
70,2a gavayakənana is an unusual form; the only possible interpretation is as a passive arealis of gumavayakən, but then gavayakəna would be the more accepted form. Or should it be emended: gavayakəna ya?
70,3a The translation of this line is far from satisfactory. The key vord is hiniriṅan (a passive form of maṅhiriṅi), which normally means 'to be accom-panied'. However, I can make no sense of hayva tātan ('do not you not …') hana hiniriṅan (thus: 'you have to be accompanied'?) in the context here. Accordingly I take hayva as referring to Rāvaṇa's evil conduct (buddhi mūrkhâvamana) mentioned in 70,Id, and take hiniriṅan as derived from hirin (a variant of irin), which is related to New Javanese eriṅ 'to show respect', thus 'to be respected'.
70,4a Should 'ulahakənā lencC be read 'ulahakənâlena', or be emended to 'ulahakənânlend' ?
70,4d
Literally: '… people will censure him as imitating those who fall into hell'.
71,1c dhana panuṅkul is literally 'vealth to be used as a token of surrender', that is, vealth given by the conquered to the conqueror.
71,3a The syntactic function of the vord paramapānditôttama is not at all clear, and the translation of this line, therefore, is not certain. If this vord is dropped, there is no ambiguity in meaning, namely the conduct of a king in ruling his country is no different from that of the tapa practiced by an ascetic.
71,6a-b
The translation of these two lines is very tentative. I render sinamaya as it is given in various dictionaries. Zoetmulder (ZH: 4) suggests that samaya in sinamaya is related to samadhi (cf. New Javanese kaya - - - kadi), and sinamaya therefore to be rendered as 'to imagine in the depths of one's mind'. In the context such translation is not impossible.
'the king thinks what a great sage thinks' for hidep nira tikâṅhidəp is conjectural, but a better alternative is hard to propose.
71,6c The notion that a king is 'hurip in jagat kabeh' is strongly reminiscent of the phrase in 1,1a namely that srl Parvatarāja is 1 hurip iṅ sarvapramānêṅ jagat'. This leads us to a conclusion that — at least to Tantular — the king and the 'Lord of the Mountains' are two different manifestations of one and the same deity. This idea has been discussed at some length in Chapter 6.
71,7b Cf. the formulation in 71,2c: apan krama ni saṅ narendra juga tan palə-paləh i karaksan in jagat. Thus tan bəsur is a synonym of tan pale-paləh 'negligent'? (for tan bcsur see Notes 21,6d).
72,1c The 'pandita Wiṣṇumūrti' who is to be the cause of Arjuna's death is Rāma Bhārgava, who is also known as Parasu Rāma. According to Pigeaud (1967: 184; cf. p. 16, Note 21) the feud between Arjuna Saharabāhu and Parasu Rāma is used as the theme of a tvelfth century kakavin, Arjuna Sahasrabāhu. In the Purānic story, Parasu Rāma was known as the sixth incarnation of Wiṣṇu. He was born as the fifth son af Jamadagni, who was deceived and killed by king Kārtavīrya and his sons. Single-handed, Parasu Rāma destroyed all the males of the royal blood (see Daniélou 1964: 170-2). This episode is related briefly in Adip.: 3.
72,9b Nir don taṅ dina ratri is literally 'night and day are of no purpose [to him]'. The idea is that the king did nothing else, either by night or by day, than devote himself to the dharma.
73,1 a-b For a comment on this passage see Section 1.2. The reading abuka 'to begin' (literally: 'to have … as an opening', i.e. 'to have … as a begin-ning') is not without doubt. One may argue that the whole kakavin is in fact derived from the 'Daśāsyacarita', because the first part of the Utt., in other vords the source of the Arj., is no more than the story of Rāvaṇa before his encounter with Rāma. To render abuka by 'give rise to; lead to' as given in ONW: 406, however, does not fit the context. Could it be a copyist's error for kathâdbhuta, i.e. 'wonderful story' (cf. Sut. 148,1a: Nāhan tântyan ikaṅ kathâtisaya Boddhacarita il inikət 'Thus ends the versification of the most wonderful tale, the story of Boddha').
73,1c For a discussion on the name of the poet, Tantular, see Section 1.1.
73,Id lnda tan tular ika ri gatinya' is a pun, serving as a gloss to explain the meaning of the name the author had probably chosen for himself as his pen-name (parab). The rendering of tan tular by 'unsverving' or 'undeviating'
is in accordance with Zoetmulder's suggestion (see Teeuw and others 1969: 14). Berg (1969: 66-7; 368, Note 42) argues that tantular is a synonym of prapañca, which means exactly the opposite of the meaning given here. Berg's arguments, however, are not acceptable. He is right in arguing that tan tular is a synonym of tan cala, but he is mistaken when he contends that tan tular is also a synonym of cañcala, because tan cala is the negation of cañcala (cala and cañcala are more or less synonymous; see SED: 391 and 382). The Sanskrit equivalent of tan tular is drdha (thus Ram. 24,165: drdha tan tular aṅən-aṅənya tan cala). It is interesting to note that in the Bunur inscription the grantee, dyah Parih, has been given the dharmasima of Buṅur by Rāja-sanagara on account of his kadrhabhkatin to the latter's niece, the wife of Tantular's patron. Could it be that there is some connection here, namely that Tantular 'the unsverving one' was the pen-name of dyah Parih, who was renovned for his 'unsverving loyalty' to his master?
Berg (1969: 67) has amended migu (which he renders as 'restless') for milu. Milu ləṅəṅ is, in my opinion, contextually quite appropriate. The occurence of milu in this phrase is similar to tumut aṅapilaṅə̄ occurring in 73,1a or milv âmarna ri kastavan nrpati occurring in Nag. 94,1b.
Comparing the phrase 'tan vruh i rusit niṅ aji' with Sut. 148,4c '… turuṅ vruh in aji sakatha', we may assume that aji in this phrase refers to aji sakatha, i.e. the Art of narration. Here I take sakatha as being derived from Sanskrit samkathā (SED: 1125). However, it might also be possible that sakatha is derived from samkata, which means, among other things, 'impassable; dan-gerous' (SED: 1125), and it is thus the equivalent of Javanese rusit (KBW 1: 746). The phrase 'rusit niṅ aji' is also used to describe a beautiful person, probably via '[her beauty] as hard to perceive as Art' thus '[her beauty is] indescribable' (see KBW 1: 522, sub niraksara). Hence my translation 'the subtleties of the Art' for rusit nin aji in this line.
73,2a-b
For a comment on this passage see pp. 10-1.
73,2c-d
This passage refers to the future death of Arjuna at the hand of Rāma Bhārgava or Parasu Rāma and that of Dasamukha at the hand of Rāmacandra, the sixth and seventh incarnation of Wiṣṇu respectively (see Daniélou 1964: 170-5).
74,1 This stanza is puzzling. If it is related to the previous one, then durāt-maka in line 1a must certainly refer to Dasamukha as well as Arjuna. In the epic literature, this might not be surprising, for both Dasamukha and Kārta-vlrya are considered evil in the Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata cycles. However, it is hard to understand how Tantular, as a poet who has vritten a kakavin extolling the deeds of Arjuna Kārtavīrya, could say that his hero was a will.in. The only plausible explanation is that although the poet does not explicitly exclude Arjuna Kārtavīrya from the evil imputation, only Dasamukha is meant here. This suggestion is corroborated by the use of bāna 'arrow' as the veapon that is to slay this durātmaka 'the vicked soul(s)', which agrees with the story of Dasamukha's death, but not with that of Arjuna, since the latter
vas slain by Rama Bhargava, whose usual veapon was an axe (hence his name Parasu-Rāma, i.e. 'Rāma with the axe').
74,2a For parvacarita see Notes 46,6b. Here it refers to the parts of the OJ Utt.
74,2b Although ṅhulun ('I; me') is used here, for the sake of consistency I have used 'he' in the translation, since in the other parts of this passage Tantular uses the third person pronoun.
74,2d Although the literal meaning of the metaphor asoṅ karas is clear, i.e. 'to have vriting leaves as an umbrella', its significance is not apparent, except that it denotes the poet's activity of vriting a composition. A similar case is aṅituṅi paṅjrah iṅ səkar, literally: 'to count the blossoming flowers' (see P. 37).
74,3a In KBW 1: 296 we read the following quotations: 'kolug tan vikan ya ri pinaṅka nin kevəh' and 'kolug tinaṅaran [?] tan uniṅga kevəhnya', which indicates that kolug can mean 'does not know the origin of hardship; ignorant of hardship'. So, an alternative translation is: 'And so far as this Tantular is concerned, he is ignorant of hardship, for he is not in the least deterred by the derision of others'.
74,3d tādana means 'beating; striking; chastising' (see SED: 441; ONW: 223), but it does not seem to fit the context. Other possible readings, buddhitā dhana or buddhitâdhana, likevise do not make sense.
74,4b vruh iṅgita is the Javanese equivalent of Sanskrit iṅgita-jña (SED: 164), which means 'understanding signs; acquainted with the gestures of another; skilled in the expression or interpretation of internal sentiments by external gesture'.
74,4c In Old Javanese kahañan normally means 'to be captured', especially in reference to girls from a defeated state captured by the victor (see e.g. KBW 1: 374). It is doubtful vhether this meaning is appropriate here. In New Javanese ṅañaṅ means 'to bid for' (JNW 1: 39), hence my translation 'to be taken' in the sense of 'to be purchased' for kahañaṅ. It is interesting to note that the Old Javanese vord for 'to attack', or 'to win a possession' is anuku (e.g. 4,13c; Nit. 2,2d: uttama niṅ hinuttama dhanôlih iṅ anuku musuh), which is derived from suku. Anuku, however, can also mean 'to buy', although in this case the vord is derived from tuku. Probably there is a tenuous semantic connection between these vords: suku — hañaṅ — tuku.
74,4d The reading '… buddhi nirâgama …' does not make sense. For nirāgama, SED 540 gives: 'not founded on revelation', which I adopt here. Admittedly the function of buddhi in the syntax is not clear.
74,5c-d
Although there is no lexical difficulty in these two last lines of the poem, the exact meaning of the whole passage is not clear, and the translation
of 5c especially is no more than conjecture. Another possible translation of 5c is: 'In short, when the withered nagasari flowers at the peak [of …?] arouse poetical trance'. For 'Scripture' as a rendering for ləpihan tanah see Svellen-grebel 1936: 212. Saṅ sūksmêṅ ləpihan tanah, the god who is present in the scripture', however, is not necessarily the goddess Sarasvatī as in the case of Kor: 9,6 (cf. Svellengrebel 1936: 226). It could be any deity, invoked by the poet especially in its capacity as the god of beauty (see Zoetmulder 1957: 64-9). In this particular kakavin, it might as well be srī Parvatarājadeva, the Lord of the Mountains, whom Tantular has invoked in 1,1a.
NEW JAVANESE RENDERINGS OF THE ARJUNAWIJAYA
As Pigeaud (1967: 241) has rightly stated, the Arj. was much appreciated by Surakarta poets of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This is evident from the repeated renderings of this poem into New Javanese.
The Arjunavijaya kavi miriṅ
The oldest rendering that has come dovn to us is vritten in a type of metre, usually called kavi miriṅ (see Pigeaud 1967: 237-8). The dates of the com-mencement and the completion of the vriting of this version are recorded in chronograms occurring in the first and final cantos respectively:
Arkm. 1,1a-b:
Purva
nire
ṅ
makirtyeṅ agñeṅ maprabvatmajeṅ Javeṅ Surakarta / ri Isnen piṅ volulas Dulkijah tuhun Wavu trus karna svareṅ rat
(At
the command of the Crovn Prince of Java in Surakarta, the vriting of this poem has been commenced on Monday, 18th Dhū'l Hijjah of the year Wavu, 1729 (1803 A.D.).
Arkm. 73,1a-2a:
Pralabda niṅ anereh riheṅ Sabtu / tabəh sana vimba nira ṅ catur / Warigalit Sakban riṅ mansa kanəm / ri tuhun Jimakir kalisaṅara // sakala riṅ sudda tri viku tuṅal
(The completion of the vriting (?) [of this poem] is on Saturday, at the ninth hour of the fourth day of the vaxing of the moon, Warigalit, Sha'bān, the sixth [Javanese] month, in the year Jimākhir, 1730 (1803 A.D.).
The name of the pujaṅga who composed this version of the Arj. occurs in the following quotation (Arkm. 73,2b-3d):
Kan
tincdah
vadyaji juru-nitra / makirtya rin katarjunavijaya / lagu magcṅ rikaṅ bahasa jarva // sireka mas Yasadipureṅ ar an / kan inutus manulad riṅ pustakadi / abdi carik sira Sastrataruna / kagəṅan sri mahanarpatiputra
(His Majesty's servant, the vriter, who has been ordered to compose the tale of Arjunavijaya in 'great verse' in jarva language, is mas Yasadipura; the one who has been ordered to copy this book, which belongs to the Crovn Prince, is scribe Sastrataruna).
Since, according to a biography vritten by his descendants, Yasadipura I died on 20th Dhū'l ka'idah 1729 (= 14 March 1803 A.D.; see Soebardi 1967: 51), the Yasadipura mentioned in the abowe quotation of the Arkm. must be Yasadipura II. This argument is further corroborated by a quotation from the Arjuna Sasrabau of Yasadipura II (51,22-3).
The Arjuna Sasrabau of Yasadipura II
Sixteen years later, Yasadipura II revrote this kavi miriṅ version of the Arj. in macapat form. This macapat version has been discussed breifly by Poerbatjaraka (1964: 137).
The dates of the commencement and the completion of this macapat version are recorded in the first and final cantos respectively:
Arsy. 1,1:
Purva niṅ reh pandon in mamanis / makirtya riṅ agña prabvat-maja / ri Surakarta mandireṅ / Javi saananipun / piṅ patbəlas Rcspati Manis / Jumadilaval hasta / gatitaña nuju / Jimakir sevu kalavan / pituṅ atus catur maṅka palupi / prabhu Sahasraboja
(At the command of the Crovn Prince of Surakarta, Java, the vriting of this poem, which begins with Dandaṅgula metre, has been commenced on Thursday Ləgi, 14th Jumādā 'lūlā, at 8 o'clock, Jimākhir 1746 (1819 A.D.). As regards the story, it is about king Sahasraboja).
Arsy. 51,22:
Pi
ṅ rolikur Raməlan Jimakir / Kemis iṅ jam sangeñjaṅ sampurna / nireṅ kaṅda panitrane / Arjunasasrabau / lek iṅ kasa rovəlas ari / sənkala məksih samya / lan duk vivitipun …
(The vriting of the Arjunasasrabau poem was completed on 22nd Ramadan, Jimākhir, on Thursday, at 9 a.m., on the 12th day of the vaxing of the moon, the first [Javanese] month, the same year as the commencement of the vriting …).
That the vriter of this macapat version was Yasadipura II is clear from the following quotation (Arsy. 51,22-3):
…ṅuni pan sampun jarva // naṅiṅ məksih lagu niṅ kakavin / nulya iṅ maṅkya karsa rinampas / sinalinan lalagone / iṅkaṅ səkar macatur / kan anavuṅ sakiṅ kakavin / aṅgəgəmət in kanda / baraṅ laṅənipun / abdi jən sri naraputra / mas ṅabehi Yasadipura piṅ kalih …
(It [-the poem] had been vritten earlier in jarva language, but the metre was still that of kakavin. now the Crovn Prince wished to change the poem completely into macapat verse. The author who composed [the nev poem] from the kakavin and made a close study of the story with all its beauty, was mas ixabehi Yasadipura II, His Majesty's servant).
The Arjuna Sasrabau of Yasadipura I
However, Yasadipura II was not the first pujaṅga who rendered the Arj. into New Javanese. This is clear from the following quotation (Arsy. 51,24):
duk vaune pan sampun / ginupiteṅ juru panaṅgit / ri vus sckar macapat / karsane saṅ prabu / kapiṅ tri Pakubuvana / kaṅ tinuduh sira ṅabehi Yasadi / pura iṅkaṅ kapisan
(In accordance with the wish of His Majesty Pakubuvana III, it [= the Arj.] had earlier been rendered into macapat by a vriter. This vriter, ordered by the king to do this, was ṅabehi Yasadipura I).
Neither Poerbatjaraka (1964), nor Pigeaud (1967), nor Soebardi (1967), mentions that Yasadipura I too had made a rendering of the Arj. in New Javanese. This is probably due to the fact that there seems to be no trace of the macapat version of Yasadipura I in the Libraries of the University of Leiden and Museum Pusat, Jakarta. It is nevertheless clear from the abowe quotation that Yasadipura I had rendered the Arj. into macapat verse during the reign of Pabubuvana III (1749-88 A.D.). In other vords, this macapat version had been vritten at least 15 years before the vriting of the kavi miriṅ version.
The conclusion that the kavi miriṅ of the Arj. was vritten some time after the macapat version (of Yasadipura I) accords with Poerbatjaraka's arguments that the kavi miriṅ versions of the Devaruci and the Rama derived from the macapat versions (Poerbatjaraka 1964: 143-4; see also Pigeaud 1967: 238).
The Arjuna Sasrabau of Sindusastra (see Palmer van den Broek 1868)
Sindusastra, a pujaṅga who flourished during the reign of Pakubuvana VII, also vrote a book based on the story of Arjuna Sasrabau in macapat metre. The date of the vriting of this version is 1829 A.D. (i.e. 1245 Arabic year or 1757 Javanese year; see verse 1,1). However, this version contains much more than the stories of the kakavin. A comparison of the corresponding passages of this version with the Arj. clearly shovs that the vriter, Sindusastra, was not acquainted with, or at least did not make use of, the Arj. Its source, according to Poerbatjaraka (1964: 161) is the Serat Kanda. This version of the Arjuna Sasrabau cycle, therefore, belongs to a different tradition than the kakavin version.
A thorough study of these different versions of the Arjuna Sasrabau cycle in New Javanese would no doubt be of some significance for increasing our still indaequate knowledge of the transitional period between Old Javanese and New Javanese literature. It is obvious, however, that such an undertaking falls outside the scope of the present study.
