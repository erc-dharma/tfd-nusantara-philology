   translation : 
   [.1] Let there be no hindrances! 
 [.2]The author of the compendium spoke. His words were:
 [.3]HavingSage bowed down with the head to God, the sage without sensual desire speaks: ‘O God of Gods, Mahādeva, Parameśvara, Śaṅkara!’ 
 [.4]The reverend sage Bhārgava desired to ask the Lord about the state of extinction. Such was his intention. He worshiped the Lord with the head, by means of his head. Having finished to worship, he spoke: ‘O God of Gods, o God of all the Gods! O Mahādeva, o you who are called Lord Mahādeva! O Maheśvara,o you who are called Lord Maheśvara! O Śaṅkara, o you who are called Lord Śaṅkara!’
[.5]‘The excellent extinction, void, how is it perceived as the state of Śiva’s limbs?’ Having heard this unequalled speech, God became present. 
 [.6]‘Thus I would like to ask to the Lord. There is the state of void. That is designated as liberation. It is supreme. It is called Śiva. Is perceived, When He is seen by the Leader among Yogins, in what place, By Your leave, where is the place of His manifestation?’ The excellence of the sage’s speech being such, it was heard by the Lord. God spoke—the Lord spoke, His words were:
[.7][Here is]Lord my speech to you: within his own body, inside the heart, the great yogin sees Parameśvara, whose splendour equals that of ten thousand suns. 
 [.8]My speech to you is as follows: the great yogin sees the Lord Parameśvara—He is splendid like the splendour of ten thousand suns—there in his body, and in his heart.
[.9][The yogin] sees [a form] like a whirlpool in the water, which abides in the heart of all beings. Without beginning, middle part and end, immortal, it is the mental representation of Śiva’s [mantric] limbs. 
 [.10]The manifestation of the Lord Śiva abides in the heart of all the embodied creatures. Without beginning, without middle part, without end, Its existence is permanent. Its form is like a whirlpool in the water. It is seen by the Leader among Yogins.
[.11]It▷ 1.5 is seen through the Sense-Mind, with the equalized sight, o hero! It is perceived in the cavity of the heart, in the forehead, and within the skull. 
 [.12]Such state is seen by you through your Sense-Mind, and through the intellect that has subdued the organs of perception, there in the mass of the heart, in the forehead, and in the middle of the skull. Thus is my speech to you, o hero.
[.13]Wherever▷ 1.6-7 it is seen, it is obtained there. [There is] the shape of a lotus-bud, bringing forth a triangle. 
 [.14]If such state is seen by the Leader among Yogins, it is obtained by him there. Further, there is a triangle placed on the top of a lotus. It has an opening.
[.15]In▷ 1.6-7 the heart, between the two breasts of all the embodied beings, turned upside down, is the root of the ten tubes, which hang down from it. 
 [.16]The heart of every embodied being looks like turned upside down. It resides in the space between the two breasts. Clearly, it is the root of the ten tubes. They are special. They look like hanging down.
[.17]The▷ 1.8 Great Tube is between the breasts, thin, black, [carrying] an excellent nectar. It circulates inside the whole heart, having the same glare of pounded black antimony. 
 [.18]The Great Tube tube resides in the heart. It is black and thin. It is the great nectar. Its glare is like that of black antimony. It raises up as far as the head when [coming] from the heart.
[.19]There▷ 1.9 resides Śiva, the Chief of the Gods, void, without sense-organs, without modifications, the Great Soul, the very life of the beings. 
 [.20]There in the tube resides the Lord Śiva. He is obeyed by all the Gods. He is void. Without sense-organs, He is free from the Sixteen Evolutes. He is the highest. He is not affected by modifications. He is the life of everything that exists.
[.21]Immovable, He sets in motion the entire universe made of inanimate and animate beings. Omnipervasive, eternally existent, [He] is difficult to be known by those devoid of knowledge, o Hero. 
 [.22]The manifestation of the Lord Śiva that abides in it is omnipervasive and eternal. He observes, immovable. He is difficult to be known by those who are deficient in knowledge. He does not move in the entire universe, formed by the immovable and movable beings.
[.23]Mahādeva perpetually abides in the heart of the incarnated beings. He is perceived by the knower of the Gnosis as a great vacuity, like the atmosphere. 
 [.24]The Lord Mahādeva perpetually abides in the mass of the heart, within every embodied being. He cannot be confined: His form is like Space. He is seen by he who knows about the Gnosis.
[.25]The ten tubes would be sunbeams, issuing from the heart and spreading out within the entire body, like the rays of the sun across the universe. 
 [.26]The ten tubes travel along from the heart of the embodied beings, filling the entire universe. Their appearance is like the splendour of the sun.
[.27]The▷ 1.13-14 tube called Mālatī [resides] eight-hundred-fold inside [every] hair. Coming forth tortuously down to the navel, it brings satisfaction to Maheśvara. 
 [.28]There is the tube called Mālatī: its magnitude is eight hundred times that of a hair. It reaches the mass of the heart, having the navel as its limit. This tube, being in such a manner, gives pleasure to the Lord Parameśvara.
[.29]The tube called Nālaretakā has the radiance of a dark cloud. [It] would be two times the unit of measure [spanning a finger] in the heart, divided into parts up to the head.
 [.30]Further, there is another tube, it is called Nālaretakā. Its splendour is black like the splendour of a [dark] cloud. Its length would be two spans of the little finger. [Coming] from the heart, [it raises] up to the skull.
[.31]First I shall explain to you everything about the root of these tubes without remainder, o Indra among the kings of the twice-borns.
 [.32]First I shall teach you as follows, o king of the twice-borns. I [will] teach that to you without remainder.
[.33]Now I will explain the divine ordinance inside the heart. O Indra among the kings of twice-borns, listen carefully: there is a sanctuary in the heart.
 [.34]There is a technique that should be carried out by the master. I will teach that to you now. The Lord is treasured in your heart. You should be fully intent [on Him], o Indra among the kings of twice-borns.
[.35]In▷ 1.17 the cavity inside the heart, o hero, there are five colours, of extraordinary radiance: red, tri-coloured, black, bright yellow, and resembling a crystal.
 [.36]There are colours, five in number. Their luminosity is exceptional. They reside in the mass of the heart, which has a cavity. Their appearance is [as follows]: the red is Aghora. The tri-coloured—red, white, and black—is Tatpuruṣa. The black looks like black antimony. It is Sadya (i.e., Sadyojāta). The one like the splendour of the sun, He is Vāmadeva. The one like a rock crystal, He is Īśāna. Thus is their series. You should know that, o hero.
[.37]Pure, subtle, supreme, void, imperishable: Śiva is the state of isolation, free from disease, without cessation, without beginning, middle, or end.
 [.38]There is the state of Void. It is pure. It is supreme. It is subtle—paramasūkṣma. It is called the state of isolation, without cessation, without beginning, without middle, without end. It is the cause of everything that exists, and its place of dissolution.
[.39]Spotless, without form, without limbs, spread out, the immaculate state of the Eightfold Śiva, the supreme extinction, imperishable.
 [.40]Not affected by maculation, without form, without limbs, pervasive: that is the place of the reverend Eightfold Śiva, without defects. It is supreme.
[.41]This [state] is the supreme extinction; this is the pacifying [state] of isolation. It is called Paramātman, Mahādeva, Parameśvara.
 [.42]Such a state, it is the supreme extinction. It is the state of isolation. It is Pa\-ra\-māt\-man. It is Mahādeva. It is Parameśvara by name.
[.43]Having▷ 1.21 visualized, with the greatest concentration, Śiva as the Supreme Brahman that is said to be woven lengthwise and crosswise [in the fabric of the universe], the sage shall obtain that [state] in the heart and in the forehead. 
 [.44]There is the state of Śiva, called the Supreme Brahman. That should be visualized by the adept by means of his mind. When it is obtained, it is there in the mass of the heart. He should exercise concentration.
[.45]In the head the sage shall reach the Paramount Śiva. Having died, o hero, [he] sets out; through concentration, he firmly establishes himself [there].
 [.46]There, in his head, it should be made object of his meditation. When the adept dies, he enters the station of the Lord Śiva. He becomes closely united with the Lord Śiva by means of his concentration. Thus is my speech to you, o Hero.
[.47]By▷ 1.23 means of his very mind [the yogin] should recognize Viśvadeva abiding in the heart, having the appearance of red-brown inflamed copper, having the same splendour of a ruby gem, [having] the glare of many fires, [present] inside the innermost part of the mind, looking like a shining sun, reddish-brown as a burning fire.
 [.48]There is a red abode. Its appearance is like inflamed copper. Its glare is like a ruby gem; like a sun that has just risen; and like the blaze of fire. Its deity is Viśvadeva. It resides in the heart. Aghora is the seed-syllable there: oṁ aṁ namaḥ. That should be known by the adept [to exist] in the sky, in the innermost part of the mind, by means of his mind.
[.49]Within it there would be the three-coloured one, having the appearance of a rainbow. Its seed-syllable is the pentad of the [Subtle] Elements. Thus is the supreme Tatpuruṣa.
 [.50]There is the three-coloured one—red, white, black. There the seed-syllable is Tatpuruṣa. It abides in the heart. Its appearance is like a rainbow: black, red, white. The Five Subtle Elements and the Intellect, they serve as the abode of Tatpuruṣa, the seed-syllable there: oṁ taṁ namaḥ.
[.51]That which has been taught to be in such a manner is the vital breath of the embodied beings, in the form of the Brahmamantras. Taught to be of black colour, it has the same splendour of antimony.
 [.52]That which has been taught by me is the breath of all the embodied beings. That is the Brahmamantras. Further, there is a black colour. There the seed-syllable is Vaiṣṇavī: oṁ saṁ namaḥ. Its splendour is equal to that of black antimony.
[.53]Arisen▷ 1.26 within it, Viṣṇu is known as the Unevolved. Within it there is only radiance, which has the same splendour of ten thousand suns.
 [.54]The Unevolved Matter is Viṣṇu. It is born from the root of the heart. In the middle of the heart, there is a radiance, its splendour is like ten thousand suns. There the seed-syllable is Bāmadeva: oṁ bāṁ namaḥ.
[.55]The▷ 1.27-28 Spirit is indeed the Great Brahman, [having] the great brightness of a crystal, without compare, extremely subtle. It is known as the seed-syllable Īśvara.
 [.56]The reverend Brahman, it is the Soul. The amount of its light is exceptional. It is equal to the splendour of a crystal. The seed-syllable there is Brāhmī: oṁ īṁ namaḥ. It is very subtle. It is called Īśvara.
[.57]The Supreme Brahman is extremely subtle, undisturbed, supremely pure. Having laid together the entirety of [its] limbs, it is one thumb by measure. 
 [.58]There is what is called the Supreme Brahman. It is very subtle. It is pacified and supremely spotless. Provided with a body, the measure is that of a thumb.
[.59]Therein▷ 1.29 is an ever unknowable void, called the Spotless Śiva. It is such [when] formed by the syllables. [Yet] it is without syllables, free from disease.
 [.60]It is exceedingly difficult to know the appearance of that abode in the body. It is undisturbed, it does not vanish when produced by the syllables. And yet it is understood as being without syllables, because it has given up pleasure and pain.%
[.61]Mahādeva should be know by the best ones among the sages as being twofold. [Thereupon] one will reach the abode of Śiva—the unperturbed void, having no equal, which is liberation. 
 [.62]He is the Lord Mahādeva. He should be known by the adept. Thus is my speech to you, o hero. If he reflects [on Him] in a special manner, he reaches the abode of Śiva. Its nature is void and unperturbed, without equal in excellence. That is what is called liberation.
[.63]Every day the great yogin examines his own Soul. He should burn all the sins in this body like fire [burns] wood. 
 [.64]The method of the Leader among Yogins is that he should conjoin his Self with the Lord. If [he acts] in this manner day after day, all his sins will be burnt by him, there in his body, like fire burns trees.
[.65]If [the yogin] will burn thousands of sins with fire, as if they were wood, he will attain the state of sovereignty in his own body; he will reach liberation that is the identity with Śiva. 
 [.66]The Leader among Yogins sets fire to thousands of sins, as if they were woods, by means of a special kind of gnosis, as if it were fire. After he has already burnt them down, he meets the state of sover-\arrowrightx eignty. If he is caused to obtain the state of liberation without anything being left behind, its nature [is as follows]:
[.67]The sage obtains the supernatural power of sovereignty, [consisting in] overpowering all the beings to the highest degree. [That is] the paramount liberation, exceedingly difficult to achieve.
 [.68]The man of religion obtains the state of supernatural prowess. It is a perfection. Its outcome is to overpower to the highest degree all the beings. That is the most excellent state of liberation, as it is called. It is exceptionally difficult to obtain.
 [.69] Thus [ends] the Secret Doctrine on Brahman, Chapter 1, [in] the scripture entitled ‘The Storehouse of the Worlds’. 
    [.1]The reality called ‘Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ, Svar’ is the threefold world, pertaining to the material [creation]. The sage should apply that [syllable of] Aghora, red in colour, to the navel. 
 [.2]What is called the threefold world is as follows: Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ, Svar. The so-called Indraloka is taught by the Lord. Its colour is red. It is the Aghora seed-syllable. That Aghora should be applied by the master to the navel: oṁ aṁ namaḥ.
[.3]The abode of Brahmā and Prajāpati should appear in the form of Gāyatrī. It is to be known as the three-coloured Three Constituents. The wise should apply [them] to the belly. 
 [.4]Above that there is the station called Mahāloka, the abode of Dakṣa-Prajāpati. There the seed-syllable is Gāyatrī. The Gāyatrī has three colours: red, white, and black. They are called Three Constituents—sattva, rajas, and tamas. They should be known. They should be applied by the learned master on the belly: oṁ taṁ namaḥ.
[.5]The▷ 2.3 five pure [ontic levels] are [now] examined. The seed-syllable Vaiṣṇavī is produced, having the same splendour of black antimony. The wise should apply [it] on the region of the heart. 
 [.6]Above that there is the station called Janaloka, the abode of the reverend Viṣṇu. It is inhabited by the five pure [ontic levels]. They are: Ignorance,  Nature (sva\-bhā\-va), Nature (pra\-k{\rdit}\-ti), Unevolved Matter, Unmanifest. Such are the divisions of Viṣṇu. Their number is five. They are the Soul. The seed-syllable there is Vaiṣṇavī. Its glare is black like antimony. It should be applied by the learned master in the heart: oṁ saṁ namaḥ.
[.7]It cannot be known, it cannot be accomplished: it is only splendour, beyond the [reach of the] senses. Exceedingly brilliant on account of its inactive state, the Spirit abides in the breast. 
 [.8]Above that there is the station called Tapoloka, the place of the reverend Brahmā. The seed-syllable there is Vāmadeva. It is spoken about as Inner Soul. Its appearance is splendour only. It is not recognised by the senses. It does not act, it is not acted upon. It is the abode of the Spirit. It should be applied by the learned master to the breast: oṁ bāṁ namaḥ.
[.9]The Satyaloka is Rudra—the Brahman, the Soul without superior, the state of sovereignty, clear, supreme. The wise should apply [it] to the deepest part of the throat. 
 [.10]Above that there is the station called Satyaloka, the abode of the reverend Rudra. There the seed syllable is Īśāna. It is the Supreme Soul. It is excellent. It is the abode of the Brahmamantras. It is the Soul without superior. It is what is called the state of sovereignty. Its appearance is transparent. It should be applied by the learned master to the lowest part of the throat: oṁ īṁ namaḥ.
[.11]He should apply to the throat—the City of Śiva—the syllable a, [which is] Śiva, spotless, void, supreme, free from disease, [existing] in unmanifest form in all the beings. 
 [.12]Above that there is the station called ‘City of Śiva’, the abode of the Lord Śiva. There the seed-syllable is a. It is spoken about as Supra-Soul, clear and empty. Its name is Śiva. It is excellent, devoid of pleasure and pain, pervading all the beings. That should be applied by the learned master to the throat: oṁ aṁ namaḥ.
[.13]Śivatara is▷ sivatarasivatama exceedingly spotless, void, eternal. He should install the syllable u, the intense bliss, at the end of the palate. 
 [.14]Above that there is the stage [constituting] the abode of the Lord Śivatara. There the seed-syllable is u, exceedingly spotless and void. It is perpetually excellent, not affected by pleasure and pain. That should be applied by the learned master in the gullet: oṁ uṁ namaḥ.
[.15]Supreme, absolute, unequalled, unmovable, free from disease: Śivatama is the syllable ma. He should install it in the space between the eyebrows. 
 [.16]Above that there is the stage [constituting] the abode of the Lord Śivatama. The seed-syllable there is ma. It is excellent, superior, immovable. There is no desire in it. There is no pleasure and pain. It should be applied by the learned master in the space between the eyebrows: oṁ maṁ namaḥ.
[.17]Śiva is Unfathomable, incomprehensible, inconceivable through the mind, the excellent state of isolation, without beginning, middle and end. [He] should bind it on the forehead. 
 [.18]Above that there is the station called Isolation, the abode of the Lord Paramaśiva, without beginning, without middle, without end. [It] cannot be conceptualized by the mind, and by the intellect. The seed-syllable there is oṁ. That should be applied by the learned master on the forehead: oṁ oṁ namaḥ.
[.19]The Supreme Śiva is formless, not depending upon anything, [abiding in] the state of isolation, free from [incarnation in a] human womb, birth, and death. He should apply it above the forehead. 
 [.20]Above that there is the station called the Supreme Isolation, the abode of the Lord Paramaśiva, together with the Lord Sadāśiva. There, the seed-syllable is the oṁ. It is not affected by [being incarnated in a] human womb, birth, and death. It should be applied by the learned master on the head: oṁ oṁ namaḥ.
 [.21]Śiva as the Exceedingly Subtle, supreme, is the highest station of all the [bodily] emplacements: without beginning, middle, and end, it is situated in the interior of the skull. 
 [.22]Above that there is the station taught to be the abode of the Lord Atyantasūkṣma (‘Exceedingly Subtle’). There, the seed-syllable is the oṁ. Its existence is eternal. There is no beginning, middle and end there. It should be applied by the learned master in the interior of the skull: oṁ oṁ namaḥ.
[.23]The extinction that is Śiva, the pure, supreme and imperishable extinction, is situated in the fissure [above] the skull, [being] the ultimate casting away [of the life principle] from the extremity of the skull. 
 [.24]Above that there is the station of the Lord Nirbāṇaśiva. There, the seed-syllable is the oṁ. That is designated as the casting away. It should be applied by the learned master in the fissure in the skull: oṁ oṁ namaḥ.
[.25]He should apply the Supreme Extinction that is Śiva, the supreme void beyond void and non-void, to the Door of Śiva, o hero. He should install the syllable oṁ [there]. 
 [.26]Above that there is the station that is the abode of the Lord Pa\-ra\-ma\-nir\-bā\-ṇa\-śi\-va. The oṁ is the seed-syllable there. It should be applied by the learned master in the fontanel: oṁ oṁ namaḥ. Thus were the words of the Lord discussing the stations [and their emplacements in the body].
 [.27]That▷ 2.14 which has no form, no colour, no taste, no smell, no sound, no touch, which is free of disease, unfathomable, without beginning, middle, and end, unmeasurable, unmixed, without limbs, unconstructed, without a second, unmoving, without external marks, imperishable, undecaying, without motion, without desire, not experiencing [incarnation in a] human womb, birth, and death, having no disease, having no sorrow, having no feelings, having no stain, having no suffering, having no time, without space, without year, season, month, day and night, without being apportioned by the [three] junctures [of the day], having no hour, not abiding in any time of the day, having neither the summer semester, the winter semester, or the equinox, without instant, pacified, being spirit, without junctures, solitary, void, fixed, supreme, truthful, †vidhitāṁ| na† void beyond the void, clear, the state of isolation, without a support, benign, release, without unbelief, having no dychotomizing thoughts, having no mental constructs, the state of extinction, the Supreme Brahman, without form, having no fear, immortal—this state of Brahman, He is God, He is the summum bonum, He is Parameśvara, He is the Supreme Soul, He is the non plus ultra, whose senses have disappeared; that is the End of Brahma, the state of release, unobstructed, free from disease, the supreme extinction, without modifications, without limits, the supreme abode, unpolluted; this very [principle] is Mahādeva, more pervasive, more subtle, greater, wider, without a body, beyond the senses, the eternally beneficial ambrosia, pure, without parts, perpetual; He Himself is the mother, the father, the kinsman, the relative, the friend, the teacher, the God, very powerful, Mahādeva!
 [.28]na rūpa\ṁm, It has no form; na varṇa\ṁm, It has no colour; na rasa\ṁm, It has no taste; na gandha\ṁm, It has no smell; na śabda\ṁm, It has no sound; asparśam, It has no touch; anāmaya\ṁm, It is not affected by suffering; acintya\ṁm, It is not made object of thought; anādimadhyāntam, having no beginning, middle, and end; amita\ṁm, having no delimitation; asaṅkīrṇa\ṁm, not mixed; agātram, having no body; aracanam, not attached to form and colour; advitīyam, there is none who surpasses It as being Supreme; acalita\ṁm, without movement; aliṅgakam, there is no external mark in It; acyuta\ṁm, not lacking [anything]; akṣaya\ṁm, not diminishing; nirgata\ṁm, without motion; asp{\rdit}ha\ṁm, not desiring; agarbhajanmamaraṇam, not being affected by [incarnation in a] human womb, birth, and death; aroga\ṁm, there is no affliction in It; aśoka\ṁm, not being affected by sadness; avedanam, not experiencing affliction; asaṅsāra\ṁm, not experiencing suffering; nirmala\ṁm, not being stained; na kāla\ṁm, having no time; nākāśam, having no space; na saṁvatsarartumāsāhorātra, having no year, having no season, having no month, having no day and night; asandhyāṅśam, not apportioned by the [three] junctures [of the day]; na muhūrta\ṁm, having no hour; na velakaṣṭha\ṁm, not abiding in any time of the day; nottarāyana\ṁm, not having the winter semester; na dakṣiṇāyana\ṁm, not having the summer semester; na vaiṣuva\ṁm, having no equinoctial points; animeṣa\ṁm, there is no blinking in It; śānta\ṁm, pacified; †...† śūnya\ṁm, void; dhruva\ṁm, with concentrated attention; para\ṁm, supreme; satya\ṁm, sincere; †vīta\ṁm† śūnyātiśūnyam †...†; svaccha\ṁm, clear; kaivalya\ṁm, the state of isolation; nirāśrayam, having no support; śiva\ṁm, It is called Śiva (‘benign’); mokṣa\ṁm, It is the state of release; niraśraddha\ṁm, not disliking; †...† nirbāṇam, It is the state of release; paraṁ brahma, It is the Supreme among [the various levels of the] Brahman; nirākāram, having no form; na bhayam, being unaffected by fear; am{\rdit}ta\ṁm, being unaffected by death; etaṁ brahmapada\ṁm, thus is Its form, the State of Brahman, as It is called; sa eṣa devaḥ, He is God; saḥ paramārthaḥ, He is the Summum Bonum; saḥ maheśvaraḥ, He is Maheśvara; saḥ paramātmā, He is the Supreme Soul; saḥ śreṣṭhaḥ, He is excellent; vigatendriyaḥ, there are no senses in Him; tad brahmānta\ṁm, He is the State of the End of Brahman; mokṣa\ṁm, He is the state of release; aniruddha\ṁm, is not affected by pleasure and pain; nirāmaya\ṁm, not affected by sorrow; paran nirbāṇam, He is the supreme extinction; nirvikāra\ṁm, He is not affected by modifications—its meaning is ‘without cracks’; a\-mar\-yā\-da\ṁm, the supreme more excellent than the excellent; paraṁ pada\ṁm, He is the supreme abode; anāśrava\ṁm, not flowing; eṣa eva mahādevaḥ, He is called Mahādeva; vyāpīya\ṁm, He pervades the whole universe; sūkṣmīya\ṁm, He is the epitome of subtleness; māhīya\ṁm, varīya\ṁm, He is exceptional in greatness indeed; vitanuḥ, He does not have a body; atīndriyaḥ, He is superior in being unseen; hitasadām{\rdit}taḥ, He is the eternally blissful ambrosia; śuddhaḥ, He is not stained; niṣkala\ṁm, He is without parts; śāśvataḥ, He is eternal; sa eva mātā, He is the mother; sa eva pitā, He is the father; saḥ vandhuḥ, He is the relative, saḥ svajanaḥ, He is the kinsman; saḥ mitraḥ, He is the friend; saḥ guruḥ, He is the teacher; saḥ devaḥ, He is God; saḥ mahārdhikaḥ, He is very powerful. He whose condition is such, mahādeva iti—He is the Lord Mahādeva by name!
 [.29] Having▷ moonpotscomm known that Mahādeva is pervasive within all embodied beings like space within pots, one reaches supportless liberation. 
 [.30] The Leader among Yogins knows that the Lord Mahādeva pervades all the embodied beings like the space pervades all the embodied beings. In the same way, the multiple pots are the places where the single moon resides. Thus is how non-manifestation, the final destination of everything, is compressed in a limited space. [Being] the epitome of superiority over the group of six [inner stains], he reaches the stage of release. His release is without boundaries.
 [.31]In like manner Śiva, alone, resides in the eightfold condition of the gods, in the human beings, whose condition is one, and in the lower organic world, whose conditions are five. 
 [.32] The divinities, their divisions are eight: Brahmā, Prajāpati, Mahendra, Soma, the Gandharvas, the Yakṣas, the Pretas, the Pīśācas. Thus are their divisions. Human beings are single. And yet [there are] the four births, their number [is as follows]: Brahmins, warriors, workers, servants. Thus are what are called the four births. As for the lower organic world, five are its divisions: domestic animals, wild animals, birds, creeping creatures, and plants. Such are its divisions. The condition of the Lord Śiva [is that] He is one; supreme, He abides in the entire universe.
 [.33]Śiva, subtle, omnipervasive, is not perceived by the senses of the beings, like the atmosphere. He is unfathomable, ungraspable by the mind. 
 [.34]The Lord Śiva is pervasive. He is subtle, not affected by thought. He is like the space, not grasped by the mind and the senses.
[.35]Like▷ fireinwoodcomm the fire [residing] in every log is not perceived on account of its subtlety, Mahādeva is not perceived in every being on account of its subtlety. 
 [.36]The reverend Fire is in every piece of wood, but it is not seen because of its subtlety; yathā—like the atmosphere, in the same way is the Lord Mahādeva as he exists in all embodied beings. However, He is not grasped because of His subtlety.
[.37]Through▷ fireinwoodcomm the means of rubbing the fire-stick, the fire comes to exist in the world. In the same manner, through the means [of] the yoga of gnosis, the one Lord [becomes] double. 
 [.38]When the wood is used as a means, being rubbed tenaciously, the fire comes out here in the world. Just in the same manner the Lord [comes to exist], when it is visualized by means of the gnosis. You should use yoga as the means.
[.39]Having▷ fireinwoodcomm clearly perceived the spotless God in the mind [as residing] in all embodied beings like a blazing fire, one reaches the supreme goal. 
 [.40]The reverend Leader among Yogins visualizes the Lord [with] the knowledge in his mind. His appearance is spotless, [He] resides visibly in all the embodied beings. Like the splendour of the fire, His form shines. When the Lord is visualized [in this manner] by the Leader among Yogins, he reaches the state of liberation.
 [.41] Thus [ends] the scripture entitled ‘The Secret Doctrine on Brahman’, Chapter 2. 
    [.1]Spotless,▷ purusajyoti Rudra has the essence of Śiva; patient, [He is] the Life Principle, exceedingly subtle. From Him the Spirit was born. Having the appearance of the Sun, it is the Lord of everything. 
 [.2]The Lord Rudra is one in being with Lord Śiva. He is spotless. He is extremely subtle. From the Lord Rudra, the Spirit was born. Its essence is Brahmā. Being like the splendour of the sun, it is the Lord.
[.3]The Unevolved was born. It is to be known as being like a sesame seed, subtle, eternal, beyond the senses, unfathomable, difficult to grasp, consisting of tamas, insentient. 
 [.4]From the Spirit the Unevolved was born. Its reality is Viṣṇu. Its existence is eternal. It cannot be grasped by the senses. It cannot be fathomed. It is difficult to be known. It consists of tamas. It is devoid of sentience.
[.5]Thereafter, from the Unevolved the Intellect was born, yellowish, consisting of sattva. From that [Intellect] the Passion (i.e., Self-Identity) was born, red in colour, consisting of rajas. 
 [.6]From the Unevolved, the Intellect was born. Its colour is yellow. Its nature is sattva. It is eminent. From the Intellect, the Self-Identity was born. Its colour is red. Its nature is rajas.
[.7]From▷ 3.4 that Passionate [Self-Identity] what is black in colour, made of tamas (i.e., the series of the Five Subtle Elements), was born. That whose essence is ideation and thought (i.e., \manas), the origin of the series [of the Five Gross Elements], was born. 
 [.8]From the Self-Identity, the Five Subtle Elements were born. Their colour is black. Their nature is tamas. From the Five Subtle Elements the Sense-Mind was born. Its function is ideation, that is to say, to ideate (manaṅkalpa). Its nature is to consider and to imagine. Such is its outcome: ideation and deliberating.
[.9]From▷ 3.5-7 that [Sense-Mind] the Space was born—external, relating to sound, without attributes. From that the Wind [was born]—whose essence is touch, whose essence are the qualities of sound and touch. 
 [.10]From the Sense-Mind the Space was born. It is external. Its quality is sound. From the Space the Wind was born. Its qualities are sound and touch.
[.11]From Wind, Fire is produced, possessing sound, touch, and form. From that Water [is produced], whose essence consists of taste, form, sound, and touch. 
 [.12]From Wind, Fire was born. Its qualities are sound, touch, and form. From Fire, Water was born. Its qualities are sound, touch, form, taste.
[.13]The Earth [was born from Water], declared to have sound, touch, and form, and possessing taste and odour. This is what is called ‘creation’, known as ‘the twelve’ and ‘the fivefold’. 
 [.14]From Water, Earth was born. Its qualities are sound, touch, form, taste, and odour. Thus are the ontic levels, twelve in number: Rudra, Spirit, Unevolved, Intellect, Self-identity, Five Subtle Elements, Sense-Mind, Space, Wind, Fire, Water, Earth. Thus are the ontic levels. Their seed-syllables are: sa, ba, ta, a, i.
[.15]When▷ astamurticomm those [Ontic Leves] combine together, the body of the universe is produced. Śiva resides, alone, in everything that ever existed and does not exist [yet]. 
 [.16]The coming together of the ontic levels of Rudra etc. serves as the body of the whole universe. As for the Lord Śiva, He pervades the universe. He is supreme. He resides in all the ontic levels.
[.17]He▷ astamurticomm who is the One [Lord] is called Śarva in the Earth, Bhava in the Water. He is known as Paśupati in the Fire, and Īśāna in the Wind. 
 [.18]The divisions of the Lord when He resides in all the ontic levels are as follows: He is called Śarva when he resides in the Earth. He is called Bhava when He resides in the Water. He is called Paśupati when He resides in the reverend Agni (= Fire). He is called Īśāna when he resides in the Wind.
[.19]The▷ astamurticomm Lord Bhīma is in the Space, Mahādeva in the Sense-Mind. Ugra is in the Subtle Elements, while Rudra is proclaimed to be in the Passionate (= Self-Identity). 
 [.20]He is called Bhīma when He is in the Space. He is endowed with the Eight Supernatural Powers. He is called Mahādeva when He is in the Sense-Mind, without a body. He is called Ugra when He is in the Subtle Elements. He is called Rudra when He is in the Passion, being the Self-Identity itself.
[.21]He▷ astamurticomm should be known as Īśvara when He is in the Intellect. Dhāt{\rdit} (= Brahmā), the Unevolved, resides in the Earth. The Spirit, Brahman, is in the Consciousness. He is Maheśvara when He is the Cause. 
 [.22]One should know as follows: the reverend Īśvara resides in the Intellect. The reverend Brahmā is [the] Unevolved; He resides in the earth. The Spirit is the consciousness of the [embodied] beings. The reverend Maheśvara serves as the Cause of them all. Thus the learned masters teach the twelve ontic levels according to their specific characteristics. The twelve ontic levels, they should be meditated upon by him. The state of release is obtained by him. He becomes united with the Lord Śiva—without beginning, without middle, without end. He is Lord Parameśvara by name.
[.23]The▷ 3.12-13 Earth is thoroughly hard. The Water is thoroughly liquid. The Fire is thoroughly hot. The Wind is thoroughly moving. 
 [.24]That which is hard in the body is Earth. The liquid in the body is Water. That which is hot in the body is Fire. That which moves in the body is Wind.
[.25]Similarly,▷ 3.4 ▷ 3.12-13 the Space is airy. The manas is thoroughly ideation. Such is what is called body. The Elemental [syllable] (bhautikā) is said to be in the navel. 
 [.26]The orifices in all the bodies are used as ways by the Air. They are ākāśabhūta (i.e., made of Space). The ideation within the body, that is the manas. Such are taught to be the body-principles of the Five Gross Elements. Their seed-syllable is Aghora, in the subtle centre of the navel: oṁ aṁ namaḥ.
[.27]The▷ 3.14ab ▷ 3.14cd Subtle Elements are like seeds and sprouts in relation to self-conception, which abides in the Passionate (= Self-Identity). The Intellect is decision. The [syllable] pertaining to the Three Constituents (gauṇikā) is said to be [in] the belly. 
 [.28]The seed-syllable of the Subtle Elements is ta. They are the outflow of the Self-Identity. The nature of the Self-Identity is to relate everything to the Ego. The Intellect, its activity is to determine. Its seed-syllable is the one pertaining to the Three Constituents, in the subtle centre of the belly: oṁ taṁ namaḥ.
[.29]Then the Unevolved is placed above it. It is Vaiṣṇavī, residing in the heart. What is known as ‘the shining one’ is the abode of the human consciousness. 
 [.30]The Unevolved serves as the Unevolved Matter. Its seed-syllable is Vaiṣṇavī, in the subtle centre of the heart: oṁ saṁ namaḥ.
[.31]The Spirit is the perfect isolation, shining like the sun, of great splendour, unmixed. [It is the seed-syllable] ‘belonging to the Spirit’ (pau\-ru\-ṣa), residing in the chest. 
 [.32]The Spirit is what is called the state of perfect isolation. Its splendour is like the splendour of the sun. Its seed-syllable is the one ‘belonging to the Spirit’, in the subtle centre of the chest: oṁ baṅ namaḥ.
[.33]The cause of the Life-Principle is Śambhu, immaterial, benign, imperishable, [containing everything] from Brahmā to Parameśa, pure, subtle, unpolluted. 
 [.34]The Lord Śambhu is the cause of life. Further, the syllable relating to Brahmā is immaterial. It is clear. It is called Parameśvara. It is pure and subtle. It is permanent. It is situated in the throat: oṁ iṁ namaḥ.
[.35]This is what has been taught as consisting of five parts. By virtue of the unity of the possessors of the body with the world, and by virtue of the oneness [of the world] with the body, [the yogin] reaches the [supreme] reality. 
 [.36]The principle consisting of five parts is as follows: oṁ aṁ taṁ saṁ baṁ iṁ. That is the explanation taught by the learned masters. [It] serves as the soul of the world. As for he who knows the soul of his body [to be the same as that of the world], he will reach the Lord Śiva.
[.37]The analogy of the differentiation concerns what is subject to evolution: the seeds and sprouts of everything, subtle, grow [as] shoots and branches, then are eventually carried away disorderly. 
 [.38]The seed of the Ambulu (ficus) tree is as follows. Its smallness is extreme: there are no partitions whatsoever. What are called its partitions are its roots, its shoots, its leaves. All of them, they are not perceived. At last, when the sprouts come out from the seeds of the Ambulu, they are carried away by the wind.
[.39]+The Seven Continents, the Seven Oceans, and the Great Seven Mountains.+ 
 [.40]There is what is called World, namely the Seven Continents, the Seven Oceans, and the Seven Mountains, situated in the middle of the Ocean:
[.41]There is a sea among the continents, and a conjunction of mountains in the middle. There are the Seven [Underworlds], coming forth from the Rasātala. [This] is called bhurloka. 
 [.42]There is a sea in the middle of the continents. There is a conjunction of mountains in the middle. There are the Seven Underworlds. All of those, they are called bhurloka.
[.43]Sūrya (Sun), Candra (Moon), Bhoma (Mars), Buddha (Mercury), Suraguru (Jupiter), Bh{\rdit}gu (Venus), Śanaiścara (Saturn), Rāhu, and Dhūmaketu. 
 [.44]The reverend Āditya and the reverend Candra, the reverend Aṅ\-gā\-ra, the reverend Buddha, the reverend V{\rd}haspati, the reverend Śukra, the reverend Śanaiścara, the reverend Rāhu, the reverend Dhūmaketu.
[.45]The entire circle of the asterisms, the circle of the stars, and Dhruva (Pole Star): all that is in the sky the wise ones know as the intermediate space. 
 [.46]The circle of the asterisms, beginning with the Aśvins, the circle of the stars, beginning with Bhoma, the reverend Dhruva, all of them are the abodes of the Bh{\rd}gus; that is what is called sky. That is the bhuvarloka indeed.
[.47]The ten Indras, the ten Upendras, and the ten Mahendras: threefold is the circle of Śakra. This triad is taught by the teacher. 
 [.48]The reverend ten Indras, the reverend ten Upendras, the reverend ten Mahendras: thus is the circle of Śakra. It is taught by the masters to be three[fold] in number.
[.49]I will now teach [those who are] named Śakras concisely, o best among the Bh{\rdit}gus: Māyā, Kūṭāmita, and Rātri, spotless. 
 [.50]Now I will teach you the names of the circle of Śakra. I will teach you in concise form, o son of Bh{\rd}gu. There is the Dānava called Māyā; there is Kūṭāmita; there is Rātri. They are all spotless.
[.51]Varavācya, Kaniṣṭha, the great ascetic V{\rdit}haspāla, Sudarśanatapas, and others who partake of divine pleasures. 
 [.52]There is Varavācya and Kaniṣṭha; there is V{\rd}haspāla; there is Sudarśanatapa. There are also other gods besides them: their pleasures are divine.
[.53]Thus is the entire circle of Śakra, beginning with Purandara and the likes, among the many thousands of them, endowed with various pleasures. 
 [.54]They are all the reverend Indras. Such are the foremost among them. They all desire to have a residence [there]. That is what serves as their residence. Their number is many thousands. Equally numerous are their pleasures.
[.55]Greatly powerful, endowed with a thousand eyes, he stands on the vehicle Airāvaṇa. This Śakra-circle is known as the Elemental [seed-syllable]. 
 [.56]All of them, they mount Airāvaṇa. All of them have a thousand eyes. They are all endowed with great power. Such is their arrangement. They are given the task to carry over the head the World of Indra. Its seed-syllable is the Elemental: oṁ aṁ namaḥ.
[.57]At▷ 1.9 last I shall teach concisely the excellent abode of Prajāpati, the abode of the Constituents, above the Indraloka: it is a self-supported station, pure. 
 [.58]Finally, the world that is the abode of Prajāpati shall be taught. That is the abode of the Three Constituents: sattva, rajas, tamas. It is the abode above the Indraloka. It is excellent. The Sixteen Evolutes are in it. It is self-supported.
[.59]The▷ 3.4▷ adhibhutadhideva Sense-Mind, [whose] presiding deity is Myself, is born from the Five Subtle Elements. [It forms] the conception of what is desirable and undesirable with respect to the various objects of perception. 
 [.60]The Sense-Mind is born from the Five Subtle Elements. In the end, it is material. Its deity is the reverend Mahādeva. Its activity is to ideate; its domain is to desire and to dislike.
[.61]I am▷ adhibhutadhideva going to tell what has been declared in the Dhīśāstra †...†: Space [is born] from the Subtle Element of Sound, [which] brings about the happiness of the organ of Hearing, directed towards the domain of what can be heard. 
 [.62]The Space, its quality is the Subtle Element of Sound, which causes the organ of Hearing, as well as happiness. Its object is what would be suitable to hear.
[.63]Wind▷ adhibhutadhideva [is born] from the Subtle Element of Touch, [which] brings about the happiness of the organ of Touch. What can be touched is the object. The presiding deity is Space. 
 [.64]The Wind, its quality is the Subtle Element of Touch, which brings about the Skin and the happiness of the Touch. Its deity is the reverend Space.
[.65]Fire▷ adhibhutadhideva [is born] from the Subtle Element of Form, [which] generates the happiness of the organ of Sight. The supreme deity there is the Sun. It seizes what can be seen. 
 [.66]The Fire, its quality is the Subtle Element of Form, which generates the Eyes as well as happiness. Its deity is the reverend Āditya. Its field of action is to see what is proper.
[.67]Water▷ adhibhutadhideva [is born] from the Subtle Element of Taste, [which] brings about the happiness of the organ of Taste. There, the deity is Varuṇa. The object of enjoyment is what can be tasted, [possessing] the six tastes. 
 [.68]The Water, its quality is the Subtle Element of Taste, by which the Tongue as well as happiness are produced. Its deity is Varuṇa. Its field of action is to savour food.
[.69]Earth▷ adhibhutadhideva [is born] from the Subtle Element of Smell, [which] causes the happiness of the organ of Smell. Its deity is P{\rdit}thivī. The object is what can be smelled. 
 [.70]The Earth, its quality is the Subtle Element of Smell, which generates the Nose and happiness. Its deity is the reverend P{\rd}thivī. Its field of action is to smell.
[.71]The Organs of Perception have been taught by the supreme seer as a pentad. I shall now explain the five Organs of Action, in due order. 
 [.72]The Organs of Perception have been taught by the Lord Kapila as being fivefold in nature, for instance: Ear, Skin, Eye, Tongue, Nose. These are the Organs of Perception. Now, the Organs of Action, their number is five. Those I shall explain to you.
[.73]The Five Organs of Perception are produced in the [ontic level] whose essence is sattva. Know the Five Organs of Action as being made of tamas and rajas. 
 [.74]Then, you all, you should know that the Five Organs of Perception, their nature is sattva. But the Five Organs of Action, their nature is tamas and rajas.
[.75]From the▷ adhibhutadhideva Subtle Element of Sound [comes] the Mouth. [Its] deity is taught to be Īsvara. The object is what can be spoken. It is the origin of the God of Gods. 
 [.76]The Mouth is the Subtle Element of Sound, [i.e.] what serves as its transformation. Its field of action is to speak what is proper. Its deity is the reverend Īśvara.
[.77]The Hand▷ adhibhutadhideva is born from the Subtle Element of Touch. [Its] presiding deity is Indra. Its object is what can be grasped. The [other] deity is the everlasting Vāyu. 
 [.78]The Hand, its cause is the Subtle Element of Touch. Its deity is the reverend Indra. Its field of action is to grab. Its other deity is Vāyu.
[.79]The▷ adhibhutadhideva anus [comes] from the Subtle Element of Form. Maitrī is the appointed god. Its object is what is excreted. He uses the form of Agni. 
 [.80]The Anus, its cause is the Subtle Element of Touch. The reverend Maitrī is its deity there in the body. Its field of action is to fart and to defecate. He assumes a bodily shape as the reverend Agni.
[.81]The▷ adhibhutadhideva Sexual Organ, o hero, [comes] from the Subtle Element of Taste. Moreover, it is said to be Prajāpati. Its nature is sensual pleasure, and the emission of semen and urine. 
 [.82]The Sexual Organ, its cause is the Subtle Element of Taste. The reverend Prajāpati is its deity there in the body. Its field of action is to enjoy pleasure. It emits semen and urine. Thus are my words to you, o hero.
[.83]The▷ adhibhutadhideva Feet [are born] from the Subtle Element of Smell; having the nature of going and coming, they walk on the earth. The god Viṣṇu [resides] in both. 
 [.84]The two Feet, their cause is the Subtle Element of Smell. Their field of action is to move and stay put. Their task is to kick away and to stumble. They have to be restrained by the learned master.
[.85]The Organs of Perception are five; they become happy by way of the Five Gross Elements. What is called ‘body’ is endowed with them. [Its seed-syllable] is called Elemental. 
 [.86]The Organs of Perception are five in number. The reverend Five Gross Elements are used by them as [means to generate] happiness. Such is the reality of what constitutes the body of all the incarnated beings. Its seed-syllable is taught to be Aghora. Such are the words of the learned master. oṁ aṁ namaḥ.
[.87]Earth,▷ 1.9 Water, Fire, Wind, Space, Sense-Mind, and the Ten Organs, [belonging to the] external [world], are the Sixteen Evolutes. 
 [.88]Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Space, Sense-Mind, and the Ten Organs, all of them are in the exterior [dimension of the human being and cosmos]. They are called the Sixteen Evolutes.
[.89]Flesh,▷ 3.45-52 bones, muscles, bile, hair, bodily hair, nails, as well as the heart and so on—all of them are taught to be Earth, fivefold. 
 [.90]Further, I will teach you as follows: the flesh and bones, muscles, hair, hair of the legs, the ‘black’ (i.e., bile?), kidneys, lungs, liver, heart, and spleen, all of them, they are considered as [the element] Earth in the body, skin in the first place. They have to be known as the outcome of the Five Gross Elements.
[.91]Blood,▷ 3.45-52 urine, semen, sweat, phlegm, saliva, marrow, [brain-]sap, and [the humours] beginning with bile are taught to be Water, fivefold. 
 [.92]The blood, urine, sweat, saliva, bone marrow, brains: the nature of all of them is liquid. They are the water in the body. They originate from the Five Elements.
[.93]The▷ 3.45-52 fire that is Great is in the mouth, the Gārhaspatya in the belly; the fire Dakṣiṇa resides in the heart, Sambarta in the gall. 
 [.94]The reverend Mahadagni is in the mouth. The reverend Gārhaspatyagni is in the belly. The reverend Dakṣiṇāgni is in the heart. The reverend Sambartakāgni, it resides in the gall.
[.95]In▷ 3.45-52 this system, the pure anus and sexual organ are declared to be the fire Cākṣuṣa. The Fire is known as fivefold in the bodies of the embodied beings. 
 [.96]The reverend Śucyagni is in the anus and sexual organ. The reverend Cāk\-ṣu\-ṣāg\-ni is in the eyes. Such is the series of the reverend Agnis [as] the Five Gross Elements. [They are] taught by the scripture to dwell in the body.
[.97]The▷ 3.45-52 breaths should be known as five in number—they are to be known even by the learned masters: Prāṇa, Apāna, Samāna, Udāna, and Byāna. 
 [.98]The holy breaths, their number is five. They have to be known by the learned masters. They are Prāṇa, Apāna, Samāna, Udāna, Byāna.
[.99]The breath▷ 3.45-52 [dwells] in this entire body as one, possessing five modes of existence. The Prāṇa is in the face, the Apāna is in the lower region; the Samāna resides in the heart. 
 [.100]The breath resides in the body of all the beings, unique. [Yet] their number is five. Their order is as follows: the Prāṇa breath is in the face. The Apāna is in the anus. The Samāna is in the heart.
[.101]The▷ 3.45-52 Udāna should be known to be in the head, the Byāna in all the joints of the limbs.lednopb 
 [.102]The Udāna is in the head. The Byāna is in all the limbs of the body.
[.103]The▷ 3.45-52 Space is known as fivefold: it exists everywhere in the ear, in the eyes, in the mouth, in the heart, in the belly, in the anus, and the reproductive organs. 
 [.104]Ears, eyes, nose, heart, anus, reproductive organs, bones: all of them are Space. It is the foremost of the Five Gross Elements.
 [.105][Thus ] one should particularize these five, called Five Gross Elements. They are what is called the ‘body of everything’ [that exists], endowed with material and spiritual dimensions. 
 [.106]Such are their kinds. Their distinctions are five. They are called the Five Gross Elements. All of them, they serve as the body of all beings, which are affected by the pain relating to material beings as well as the pain relating to spiritual beings.
[.107]I shall tell you their distributions, according to their true nature. From whichever locus [an Element] has arisen, there it approaches. 
 [.108]As for all their distributions, here is the progression as they are joined together, [as well as] their number and their [respective] destinations.
[.109]The▷ adhibhutadhideva Nose satisfies itself with odours; Earth satisfies itself with food. The Tongue satisfies itself with taste; Varuṇa (i.e., Water) constantly satisfies Himself. 
 [.110]The Nose is satisfied with odours. The reverend P{\rd}thivī is happy in this manner. The Tongue is satisfied with the pleasant taste of food and drink. Its body is Water. The reverend Varuṇa is satisfied in this manner—perpetually satisfied.
[.111]The▷ adhibhutadhideva Eye satisfies itself with forms. The Sun is constantly satisfied. The Skin satisfies itself with touch. The Wind is satisfied. 
 [.112]The Eye is satisfied with looking at forms and colours. The reverend Āditya is always satisfied in this manner. The Skin is satisfied with touch. The reverend Vāyu is always satisfied in this manner.
[.113]The▷ adhibhutadhideva Ear satisfies itself with sounds. Bhīma satisfies Himself with Space. The Foot satisfies itself with going and coming. Viṣṇu is pleased. 
 [.114]The Ear is satisfied with excellent sounds that are pleasant to hear. The Lord Bhīma is satisfied with the whole Space in this manner. The two Feet are satisfied with going and staying put. The Lord Viṣṇu is pleased in this manner.
[.115]The▷ adhibhutadhideva Genital Organ is satisfied in the domain of sensual pleasure. There Prajāpati [resides]. The Anus [is satisfied] in the domain of excretion. The god Maitri is satiated. 
 [.116]The Genitals are satisfied in the domain of sensual pleasure. When he is the foremost [deity] there, the reverend Prajāpati is constantly happy. The Anus is satisfied in farting and defecating. The reverend Maitri is satisfied in this manner.
[.117]The▷ adhibhutadhideva Hands are satisfied in the domain of seizing. Indra is satiated. The [Organ of] Speech satisfies itself with its own domain—speech. Vaiśvānara [is] also [satisfied in this manner]. 
 [.118]The Hands are satisfied with grasping. In such circumstance, the reverend Indra is satisfied. The Speech is satisfied with the domain of utterances. The reverend Vaiśvānara is satisfied in this manner.
[.119][Such▷ 3.4▷ adhibhutadhideva are] all the external organs. I shall [now] speak about the Sense-Mind. The Sense-Mind is satisfied by ideations, o Hero. Soma satisfies itself perpetually. 
 [.120]Thus are all the external organs. Likewise is the manas: its states are various. My speech to you, o Hero, is as follows: the manas is satisfied with ideating. The reverend Soma is satisfied in this manner.
[.121]The▷ 3.14ab▷ adhibhutadhideva Subtle Elements [are satisfied] with being apportioned. The god Ugra is satisfied. The Self-Identity [is satisfied] with the conception of oneself. Rudra satisfies Himself with the Constituents of that. 
 [.122]The Five Subtle Elements, they are satisfied with being divided. The Lord Ugra is satisfied in this manner. The Self-Identity is satisfied in relating [everything] to the I. The Lord Rudra is happy in this manner, due to its Constituents.
[.123]Intellect▷ 3.14ab▷ adhibhutadhideva [is satisfied with] determination. Īśvara, known as Brahman, [is the deity there]. The Unevolved [is satisfied] with [being] the material cause of those [ontic levels]. Viṣṇu becomes excellent in satisfaction. 
 [.124]The Intellect is satisfied with determining. The reverend Īśvara has as seed-syllables the Brahmamantras. He is satisfied with the Unevolved. It is satisfied with [being] the material cause. The reverend Viṣṇu produces satisfaction in this manner.
[.125]The▷ adhibhutadhideva Spirit is taught to be satisfied with sentience and insentience. The presiding deity is Mahādeva. He satisfies Himself with [being the Primary] Cause [of the Universe]. 
 [.126]The reverend Spirit is satisfied with sentience and insentience. The reverend Brahmā is happy in this manner. As for the Lord Mahādeva, He is happy [with having] the condition of [Primary] Cause.
[.127]When the deitites are near their respective sensory objects, they burn all [those] objects up, [causing the] thorough purity of the Self. 
 [.128]The sensory objects, their nature is to be not far from the body. All of them should be burnt. While all the objects are burnt, it is at that time that what is called ‘the natural state of purity of the body’ (śarīraśuddhasvabhāva) [arises]. When that happens, you are regarded as embodying the [supreme] deity.
[.129]O God, greatly subtle! The God Śiva is said to be the presiding deity in that state, reaching His own object in all the ontic levels. 
 [.130]Thus is the sequence of all the ontic levels. They are all happy with their respective objects. As for the Lord Śiva, He is supreme. He pervades all the gods, as well as their objects. He resides in all the beings.
[.131]The hair of the body is the Ṛṣis, the blood is the oceans; the flesh should be known as the earth; the nerves etc. are taught to be like a river. 
 [.132]The hair, their deities are the Ṛṣi. The blood, its deity is the sea. The muscles, their deity is a river.
[.133]The bones should be known as the mountains; the kidneys etc. are taught to be the Himālaya. The entrails should be known as the Nāga, the flesh as the Seven Continents. 
 [.134]The bones, their deities are the mountains. The kidneys, their deity is the Himālaya. The entrails, their deity is Nāga. The flesh, their deities are the Seven Continents. These should be known as their [respective] deities.
[.135]The god of the two flanks is said to be the conjunction of mountains. In this manner all [the parts of the body] are taught to be fivefold, made of the Gross Elements. 
 [.136]The two flanks, their deity is the conjunction of mountains. [The parts of the human body,] all of them are taught by the learned master as having the nature of the Five Gross Elements, [according to] the words of the Great Sage.
[.137]Śiva abides in all the beings, alone. When all of them are satisfied, Śiva alone is satisfied. 
 [.138]As for the Lord Śiva, He is satisfied within all the beings. The meaning is: when all of them are happy, in that case the Lord Śiva alone is happy.
[.139]He knows that Śiva is, among the souls in all beings, the first (ādi); [He exists]—at once unique and manifold—within everyone of those [beings], everywhere, and is known as the Cause of them [all]. 
 [.140]The reason why it is so is because the origin of all the beings is from the Lord Śiva, as the scripture (tattva) says. He is the body of the constituents of all the beings, for He is the Cause of everything that exists. That is what should be kept in mind by one who knows the scriptures.
[.141]All▷ cidvalli the ontic levels exist [latently], then they are spread once more. As long as the Lord [is in a state of] production, the ontic levels constantly exist. 
 [.142]All the ontic levels exist [latently] in the Lord Śiva. At last they come out from Him. What is the reason for this to happen? As they constitute the body of the Lord Śiva, the existence of all the ontic levels is constant.
[.143][Śiva] would▷ cidvalli contract the ontic levels once more. They dissolve again into the possessor of the ontic levels, who is this entire universe as well as the One, like the foam is seen [to emerge] from the water. 
 [.144]When the Lord Śiva is in this state, within all the ontic levels, at last [they] dissolve into Him again. The example of this is as follows: like the foam, whose manifestations are numerous, it is one only [as it originates] from the water.
[.145]All the ontic levels exist. The ontic levels are dissolved again. Thus is Rudra with the eight supernatural powers: Śiva, omnipresent, all-pervading. 
 [.146]\sqbrl The foam,] when it comes out, is situated in the water, its cause; at last, it dissolves into the water. It is like that. So is the Lord Rudra: He is endowed with the eight supernatural powers. He is Śiva. He is present everywhere. He is all-pervading.
[.147] As long as [He] guards this entire universe, it constantly exists. At last it contracts once again, reaching the [supreme principle constituting the] totality of the ontic levels. 
 [.148] He, called the Lord Rudra, guards the entire universe. Its continual existence lasts for so long as the period during which He guards. At last, when He causes it to be dissolved, everything goes back to Him.
[.149]Just as Rudra acts with the aim of dancing, one who has worldly attachment does not know [Māyā. When the Lord’s] well-fixed manifestation is shaken, surely the illusory Māyā is seen. 
 [.150]The Lord Rudra is thus: like a dancer who is adorned for the audience, having in mind his desire to dance. When such [dance] has finished, the illusory Māyā is shown. Yathā, it is the same for the human beings that are affected by the desire for the objects of the senses, not knowing that they are being affected by the illusory Māyā of the reverend Rudra.
[.151]Thus the Soul, possessing the eight supernatural powers, having been made threefold, is not relinquished; together with Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Īśvara, it becomes threefold [even though it is] one only. 
 [.152]The reverend Soul is in such a manner: it is endowed with the eight supernatural powers. Its body is caused to be threefold: Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Īśvara. It is in harmony with the triad. Thus is its real essence while being three [entities].
[.153]Soul, Inner Soul, Supreme Soul, Supra-Soul: the Soul is fourfold within mankind—one only, in four parts. 
 [.154]Thus are the divisions of the reverend Soul: Soul, Inner Soul, Supreme Soul, Supra-Soul. Its divisions are four within mankind. Its portions are four, yet its real essence is one.
[.155] The Soul should be known as Viṣṇu, the Inner Soul as Pitāmaha (i.e., Brahmā). The Supreme Soul is Mahādeva, the Supra-Soul is said to be Śiva. 
 [.156]The reverend Viṣṇu is the Soul. Brahmā is the Inner Soul. Mahādeva is the Supreme Soul. The Lord Śiva is the Supra-Soul. The †...† is taught by the learned master.
[.157]The emitter of Brahmā begets the universe. He resides in Viṣṇu as the protector. Destruction is in the state of Rudra. [Such is what] is called Trimūrti indeed. 
 [.158]The manifestations of the Lord Śiva causing the universe [are as follows:] He has the form of Brahmā as He emits the universe. He has the form of Viṣṇu as He protects the universe. He has the form of Rudra as He destroys the universe. Thus are His three bodies. [Only] the names are different.
[.159]Viṣṇu resides in the manas as the Soul of all the beings. Pitāmaha resides in the manas of all the gods as the Inner Soul. 
 [.160]The Lord Viṣṇu is the Ātman, residing in the manas of all mankind. The Lord Brahmā resides in the manas of all the deities.
[.161]Parameśvara, existing in the Supreme, dwells as the Supreme Soul in the subtle [realities]. The Supra-Soul is Śiva indeed, difficult to be known because [He] resides in the void. 
 [.162]The Lord Parameśvara resides in the subtle gods. He is the Supreme Soul. The Lord Śiva is the Supra-Soul. His abode is difficult to obtain, for He is subtle, void.
[.163]This appearance, consisting in all stationary and moving beings, is a mere illusion (māyāmātram). Everything has the essence of Śiva, and is dissolved into the ontic level of Śiva. 
 [.164]The entire universe, whose body consists of stationary and moving beings, its nature is illusion. Everything that exists in it is the form of the Lord Śiva. The entire universe at last dissolves into Him.
[.165]As everything has arisen from Me, so the universe dissolves [in Me]. As everything is produced, so it exists and dissolves. 
 [.166]All the universes arise from the Lord Śiva, and they dissolve into the Lord Śiva.
 [.167]Thus ends the Scripture entitled ‘The Secret Doctrine on Brahman’, Chapter 3.
    [.1]Earth undergoes dissolution into Water. Water enters into Fire. Fire dissolves into Wind. Wind enters into Space. 
 [.2]Earth dissolves into Water. Water dissolves into Fire. Fire dissolves into Wind. Wind dissolves into Space.
[.3]Space goes into the manas. This is what is called the elemental body, the manifestation of the Elemental seed-syllable. It is said to be the condition of the body. 
 [.4]Space dissolves into the manas. Such are the six ontic levels. At that time, their activity is to use the body as a residence. Their seed-syllable is taught to be the Elemental (bhautikā): oṁ aṁ namaḥ. The learned masters teach that these ontic levels are the body of the Five Elements.
[.5]The manas enters into the Subtle Elements. The Subtle Elements disappear into the Passionate. The Passionate enters into the Intellect. [Such is] the subtle body, pertaining to the Constituents. 
 [.6]The manas dissolves into the Five Subtle Elements. The Five Subtle Elements dissolve into the Self-Identity. The Self-Identity dissolves into the Intellect. Thus are the ontic levels whose body is subtle. Their seed-syllable is the one pertaining to the Constituents (gauṇikā): oṁ taṁ namaḥ.
[.7]This is the [reality] of the bodies of the gods, characterized by an essence that is both manifest and unmanifest. The Intellect enters into the Unevolved, abundant in darkness, beyond the [grasp of the] senses. 
 [.8]Such are the ontic levels serving as the body of the deities, so they say. Their forms are as follows: the Intellect dissolves into the Unevolved. Its nature is darkness. It is subtle.
[.9]Unfathomable, extremely difficult to perceive, [it is] called the seed-syllable of Vaiṣṇavī. The Unevolved goes into the Spirit, resembling a spotless sky. 
 [.10]It cannot be thought upon, like a spotless sky. It is difficult to be perceived. Its seed-syllable is Vaiṣṇavī: oṁ saṁ namaḥ. The Unevolved dissolves into the Spirit. There the seed-syllable is oṁ baṁ namaḥ.
[.11]Luminous,▷ 1.26 empty, absolute: the Spirit is said to be the Brahman. Having gone into the Supreme, the Spirit is said to be the immaterial Lord. 
 [.12]The Lord Brahmā is what is called Spirit. Its appearance is like the splendour of the sun. Its emptiness is extreme. [Thus] is taught by the learned master. The reverend Spirit dissolves into the Lord Śaṅkara. Its nature is immaterial.
[.13]The truly existent Life, spotless, empty: it is called Brahmeśānī. This seed-syllable that I have taught is the cause of the dissolution of the universe. 
 [.14]The Lord Īśvara is the true life. He is Spotless. He is empty. Its seed-syllable is Brahmeśānī: oṁ iṁ namaḥ. The principle that I have taught, that it the cause of the dissolution of the universe. Thus spoke the Lord.
[.15]Having▷ 2.3▷ visnumj known this, the Great Yogin proceeds towards the supreme abode. What is known as Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ, and Svar, is designated as Unevolved Matter, etc. 
 [.16]As for the Leader among Yogins who knows the ontic levels, he enters the supreme abode. There is the Threefold World, as it is called: Ears, Skin, Eyes, Tongue, Nose, Speech, Touch, Form, Taste, Smell, Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Space, manas—such are its forms. It is placed in the jaws. The seed-syllable there is Gāyatrī. It is taught by me [thus]: oṁ taṁ namaḥ. There are what are called the five pure [ontic levels]: Nature (svabhāva), Ignorance, Unevolved Matter, Nature (prak{\rdit}ti), Unevolved. Thus are the five [pure ontic levels]. Their seed-syllable is Vaiṣṇavī: oṁ saṁ namaḥ.
[.17]The Supreme Station is without denomination. The [seed-syllable] pertaining to the Spirit (Pauruṣa) is said to be in the breast. It is called Brahmākṣara, the supreme bliss, unmeasurable. 
 [.18]There is a supreme station. It is Brahmākṣara. Brahmā is its deity, in the locus of the chest. There the seed-syllable is the one pertaining to the Spirit: oṁ baṁ namaḥ. There is a supreme station. Brahmā is its seed-syllable. Equally, Brahmā is its deity: Brahmādhipati. It resides in the throat. oṁ iṁ namaḥ.
[.19]The syllable oṁ is the supreme abode, the supreme sound that is higher than the extremely high, empty, unique, immovable. [Now] listen to everything about those [worlds] in\ detail. 
 [.20]The syllable oṁ is the supreme station, void. It is higher than the station of Īśāna. It is supreme. The respective characteristics of the worlds should be known. I'm going to teach you that.
[.21]The human race is in the bhurloka. The atmosphere is the bhuvarloka. The circle of Śakra is the svarloka. Thus is what is called the domain of the Threefold World (trailokya). 
 [.22]The bhurloka is the abode of the human beings. The bhuvarloka is the atmosphere. The svarloka is the abode of the Indras. Such is what is called Threefold World.
[.23]The Mahāloka is [the world] relating to Prajāpati. The Janaloka is [the world] relating to Viṣṇu. The Tapoloka is the abode of Brahmā. The Satyaloka is [the world] relating to Śaṅkara. 
 [.24]The Mahāloka is what is called Prajāpatiloka. The Janaloka is what is called Viṣṇuloka. The Tapoloka is what is called Brahmaloka. The Satyaloka is what is called Śaṅkaraloka.
[.25]The Eightfold Śiva is supreme, the single principle, immovable, benign, free of cause, empty, real, unpolluted. 
 [.26]There is the supreme station. It is the syllable uṅ. It is not diminishing. Further, [there are] specific qualities of the names of the reverend Eightfold Śiva. Their explanation is as follows.
[.27]Having been heard carefully, they should also be retained in the mind †manaḥ†: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Space, and manas. 
 [.28]The specific qualities of the reverend Eightfold Śiva will be taught by me. Hold them fast in your mind. Pay full attention! Thus are all the learned masters—they pay full attention in their minds. Here they are: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Space, and manas.
[.29]The one life-principle is the Threefold World indeed. The origin is from the succession of no other [than that]. Earth and Water are to be known as Bhūḥ. Fire and Wind have to be known as Bhuvaḥ. 
 [.30]The Threefold World is taught by the learned masters as follows. Know the enumeration of the worlds! The Earth and the Water are united by the learned masters: that is what is called bhurloka. The Fire and the Wind, they are what is called bhuvarloka.
[.31]The Space and the manas are called svarloka. {\curlybl}The Seven Islands, the Ocean, and the Seven Great Mountains.{\curlybr} 
 [.32]The Space and the manas, they are what is called svarloka.
[.33]Thus is the Unevolved: it is subtle, as if there is nothing that can be fathomed. This entire universe, [consisting of] the movable and immovable beings, comes from that. 
 [.34]Yathā—as if; evaṁ—thus is the Unevolved: its nature is subtle. Nothing can be fathomed in it indeed. The entire world comes from the Unevolved. Its body are the movable and immovable beings.
[.35]Like when a moonstone, o Hero, comes in contact with the moonlight, the water comes out from inside it [and], having spread out, it grants various enjoyments. 
 [.36]\sqbrl This process] could be illustrated differently, as follows: the water comes from the moonstone-jewel because of the union with the light of the moon. Eventually, its stream is abundant on the earth.
[.37]In like manner, when the Unevolved—supreme and subtle—meets with the Spirit, Māyā becomes a bestower of ontic levels, from Intellect down to Earth. 
 [.38]Tadvat—Likewise is the Unevolved, extreme in her subtleness. When she unites with the Spirit, the ontic levels from Intellect down to Earth are born, coming forth from the Unevolved.
[.39]\Sat, \rajv, and \tamv\ are called ‘the state pertaining to the Three Constituents’. By means of their going asunder, the Unevolved becomes the universe. 
 [.40]Sattva, \raj, and \tam: they are called the Three Constituents. The going asunder of the constituents, that is the cause for the world to be born from the Unevolved: [that] is the meaning of ‘going asunder’. If \satv\ is predominant, a human being comes into existence. If \tam\ is predominant, an animal comes into existence. Thus is the order.%
[.41]Error▷ 4.21-22 is fivefold, the abilities are twenty-eight; contentment is to be known as ninefold, and perfection as eightfold. 
 [.42]There are what are called five errors. There are what are called twenty-eight abilities. There are what are called nine contentments. There are what are called eight perfections.
[.43][Further,▷ 4.21-22 there are] the five wombs determined by karma, and the five afflictions of the embodied beings. This is the doctrine [taught] in the Treatise on the Sixty Categories of the great seer Kapila. 
 [.44]There are the wombs determined by karma, five is their number. There are the five afflictions, five is their number. Thus are the fifty categories, which constitute the doctrine of the most reverend Kapila. The essence has been spoken.
[.45]The▷ adhibhutadhideva origin of Intellect is from Nature. Brahmā is the presiding deity there. The object is what is visible. The \satv\ makes it visible. 
 [.46]The Intellect is born from Nature. Brahmā is its deity. Its field of action is to know. The sattva shows it.
[.47]The▷ 3.14ab▷ adhibhutadhideva origin of the Self-Identity is from the Intellect. Rudra is the presiding deity there. The object is the conception of oneself. Inasmuch as it is \rajv, it is related to Rudra. 
 [.48]From the Intellect arises the Self-Identity, the attitude to not want to be inferior. The reverend Rudra is its deity. Its domain is to relate [everything] to an I. That is what is called rajas.
[.49][From▷ adhibhutadhideva the Self-Identity come] the Subtle Elements, having five subdivisions. Ugra is the presiding deity there. What can be divided [into the Five Gross Elements] is the object. [Thus] the nature of Śiva has been revealed to you. 
 [.50]From the Self-Identity the Five Subtle Elements are born. Their deity is the reverend Ugra. They are the cause of the Five Gross Elements. The fivefold Subtle Elements [are produced] according to their own will. The Subtle Elements are five in number, whatever is their desire.
[.51]Mārīci, Kaśyapa, Viśvāmitra, Vaśiṣṭha, Bh{\rdit}gu, Aṅgirasa, as well as Jamadagni. 
 [.52]Thus are the forms of Prajāpati: the most reverend Marīci, Kaśyapa, Viśvāmitra, Vaśiṣṭha, Bh{\rd}gu, Aṅgirasa, and Jamadagni.
[.53]Beginning with such likes are the fourteen sons of Dakṣa-Prajāpati, four-faced, four-armed, whose splendour is like ten millions suns. 
 [.54]All of them are the children of the most reverend Prajāpati-Dakṣa, the great seer. Thus are foremost among them; their [total] number is fourteen. They are equal with respect to their supernatural prowess. They are all four-faced. They are four-armed. [They are] like the power of ten millions suns.
[.55]A thousand▷ visnumj times an uncountable quantity, they dwell in the Mahā\-lo\-ka. They all delight in [the ontic level] consisting in the Three Constituents, and they are stored in [that level,] consisting in the Three Constituents. 
 [.56]They dwell in the Mahāloka. Their number is a thousand times an uncountable quantity. They all desire the Three Constituents. They are the enjoyments coming from the favour of the Creator. That which is called [the ontic level] consisting in the Three Constituents, it equally produces sattva, rajas, tamas.
[.57]The▷ visnumj mantra is said to be the one pertaining to the Constituents (gau\-ṇi\-kā). It declared to be relating to the Three Constituents. The supreme abode belonging to Viṣṇu is proclaimed to be a group of five. 
 [.58]The mantra there is the one pertaining to the Constituents. That is the abode of sattva, rajas, and tamas. Such is the order, as it has been taught by me. oṁ taṁ namaḥ. There is the place that is the abode of the reverend Viṣṇu. It is supreme. It is what is called pañcavarga, which is taught by the learned masters.
[.59]Ignorance,▷ 2.3▷ visnumj Nature (svabhāva), Unevolved Matter, Nature (prak{\rd}ti), and Unmanifest: supreme and subtle, the [reality] belonging to Viṣṇu has five names. 
 [.60]What is called pañcavarga—the divisions of the reverend Viṣṇu—is as follows: Natural Disposition, Unevolved Matter, Nature, and Unevolved. Thus is Viṣṇu, five are his divisions. They are supreme. They are subtle. Their seed-syllable is Vaiṣṇavī: oṁ saṁ namaḥ.
[.61]Nothing▷ visnumj whatsoever is immaterial [in it]. It is called Viṣṇuloka. [Its deity is] four-faced, four-armed, maintainer of the four aeons. 
 [.62]That station, there is nothing else than material reality in it. It is called Viṣṇuloka. The appearance of all the deities who are there is four-faced and four-armed. They create the four aeons.

 [.66]They create all the worlds. Their own nature is creation, preservation, and dissolution; without beginning, middle, and end. They all have Garuḍas as vehicles.
[.67]Made of tamas,→ p. visnumj those inhabiting the Janaloka are called ‘belonging to Viṣṇu’. Next, [there is] the Tapoloka, very subtle, free from disease. 
 [.68]Their nature is tamas: thus is the form of the deities who dwell in the Janaloka. The seed-syllable there is Vaiṣṇavī: oṁ saṁ namaḥ. There is another station, called Tapoloka. It is extremely subtle. It is left behind by pleasure and pain.
[.69]Fivefold,→ p. brahmamj it is shining, spotless, void, immovable, fearless. Its seed-syllable is the divine Puruṣa, subtler than the subtle, supreme. 
 [.70]Its appearance is like the splendour of the sun: spotless, void, without movement. It has no fear. Its seed-syllable is Puruṣa. Its deity is Brahmā. It is subtler than the subtle. It is supreme. oṁ baṁ namaḥ}-.

 [.73]The deity who is there possesses the eight sovereign powers and the eight supernatural qualities. His brilliance has no limits. The appearance of the {\rdc}ṣis who are there is very subtle. They all engage in chastity. They all utter the Brahmamantras. The seed-syllable is Bāmadeva: oṁ baṁ namaḥ.
[.74]They all→ p. brahmamj desire constant meditation, indifferent and spotless. Four-faced, [steeped in] the Four Vedas, patients, isolated from sensory objects, firm. 
 [.75]All of them have a desire for meditation. They are indifferent to the objects of the senses. They are still and spotless. They all have four faces, and all recite the Four Vedas. They all have a forbearing aspect, and all have a concentrated attention.
[.76]Abstaining▷ brahmamj from sensual pleasure and food, they are engaged in chastity and [carry] the Brahmā-weapons. More void than the void, eternal, devoid of addiction to anything. 
 [.77]Not affected by pleasure and pain, not affected by revulsion and desire, they all grasp the Brahmā-weapons. They are [more] void than the void. Their existence is permanent, without end. They are not affected by any kind of objects of the senses.
[.78]Without beginning,▷ brahmamj middle, and end, and knowers of all sciences, they eternally reside in the Tapoloka, free from old age and death. 
 [.79]Without beginning, without middle, without end, they are knowledgeable about all the sciences. They reside in the Tapoloka eternally, not affected by old age and death.
[.80]Free▷ brahmamj from birth from a womb and old age, devoid of attachment and defilements, endowed with the eight sovereign powers, and whose appearance is a limitless splendour. 
 [.81]He is abandoned by [the state of being born from] a womb, old age, and death. He is not affected by the defilements and the objects of the senses. He possesses the state of eightfold sovereign prowess. His brightness is limitless. Thus is the appearance of the deity who is in the Tapoloka.
[.82]There▷ rudramj is a world that is superior to that because of [its] exceeding subtleness, eternal. It is difficult to grasp and to fathom. It is void, spotless to the highest degree. 
 [.83]There is a world that is superior to the Tapoloka, supreme among what is subtle beyond the subtle. Without boundaries, it is difficult to be grasped and fathomed. It is void, exceptional in clarity. Īśāna is the seed-syllable there: oṁ iṁ namaḥ.
[.84]Without▷ rudramj support, without equal, †virahakam†, beyond the senses; there the greatly powerful Rudra [resides], independent, without desire. 
 [.85] Without ceasing, without equal, without movement, not grasped by the senses. There is the abode of the Lord Rudra. His fiery energy is exceptional, without support, not affected by desire.

 [.87]He is supreme by way of the eight supernatural powers. Independent, without limbs, without body, He is excellent in superiority; empty, His glare is clear.
[.88]Three-coloured,▷ rudramj abiding in the Three Constituents, joined with the supreme Three Constituents, endowed with the supernatural qualities of the five sovereign powers: an ocean of [Rudras] wearing twisted hair.

[.92]Devoid▷ rudramj of birth, death and old age, free from disease and suffering, it is called that whose limbs are the Brahmamantras, the station higher than the highest. 
 [.93]Not affected by birth, jarā—old age, youth, and death. It is abandoned by disease and suffering. Thus is the nature of the group of the incarnations of Rudra who abide there. Such a station, it is the body of the Brahmamantras. Unaffected by fear, it is the station higher than the high.
[.94]Having known that eminent abode, [the yogins] turn that station into their body. Because of the unity of the body with that World-Egg, they reach the Supreme. 
 [.95]When the sage knows the abode, he obtains it. Thus is the unity of the World-Egg, having as form the unity of the body.
[.96]The station of the Five Mantras is to be known by those who have mastered the Elemental gnosis. The syllable a is the supreme void, the syllable u is the supreme station. 
 [.97]The station of the syllables is the holy Pañcabrahmamantra taught by the learned masters: sa, ba, ta, a, i. Being the right measure of the knowledge, it should be known. Further, the syllable a is the Supreme Void, the syllable u is the Supreme Reality.
[.98]The syllable ma is the Supreme Divine. That into which it dissolves is the Supreme Station. Having completely dissolved, it is abandoned by mantras in the form of syllables. 
 [.99]The syllable ma is [the] Supreme Divine. The oṁ.is the Supreme Station. The half-moon and the dot are abandoned by the mantras in the form of syllables.
[.100]The▷ 4.51 Extinction and the Supreme Extinction are purified of speech, free from disease. This station is the Eightfold Śiva. They regard this as the station of release. 
 [.101]The Resonance and the End of the Resonance are purified from speech. They are what is called Supreme Reality. They are deprived of happiness and suffering. Thus is what is called the eightfold station. The Lord Eightfold Śiva abides there. That is what is called the station of release, according to the Lord’s words.
[.102]One should know this as the station of the void. It is the supreme appeaser. It is the supreme state of isolation. It is the station of Maheśvara.

[.118]Higher than that is the [station of] extinction, void, divided into eight portions. [As the] sixth\ [of the states enumerated above, it is the] supreme, One, the supreme station of the Lord of the Bull. 
 [.119]There is the station positioned above the five states, called void, extinction. It serves as the sixth of the stations. The reverend Eightfold Śiva is One. He is called ‘He who has bull-footprints’ (ukṣapada), very pure. He is supreme.
[.120]The Seven Continents are taught to be Jambu, Śaṅka, Kuśa, Krauñca, Śalmalī, Gomedha, and Puṣkara. 
 [.121]What are called the Seven Continents are as follows: Jambudvīpa, Śaṅkadvīpa, Krauñcadvīpa, Kuśadvīpa, Śalmalīdvīpa, Gomedhadvīpa, Puṣkaradvīpa. Such are taught by the learned master to be the Seven Continents.

[.140]Indra▷ lokapalacommentary is in the golden peak in the east. One should assign Agni to the southeast. Yama would stay in the south, Nir{\rdit}ti would live in the southwest. 
 [.141]Their series is [as follows:] the reverend Indra dwells on the eastern peak. The reverend Agni dwells in the southeast. The reverend Yama dwells on the southern peak. The reverend Nir{\rd}ti dwells on the southwestern peak.

 [.151]Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Space, manas, Subtle Elements, Self-Identity, Intellect, Unevolved, Spirit, Lord: these are all the ontic levels. They are supreme. They make the Lord tenfold. 
 [.152] Thus [ends] the scripture entitled ‘The Storehouse of the Worlds’, Chapter 4. 
    [.1]As the Lord spoke thus, the best of sages asked again. His words were:
[.2]O[Sage] Lord! Lord God of Gods! [When one] passes away while being an embodied creature in the world, if one gives up the vital principle, should one undertake meditation on emptiness? 
 [.3]O Lord! O You, endowed with the eight supernatural powers! O Lord God of Gods! O You, king of all Gods! My question to you is as follows: if the life-principle is given up by me while I am in the cycle of rebirth, and when the human being vanishes, what should I do in those cases?
[.4]O Lord of Gods! Where do I see [the Lord]? Of what kind and how is [His] supreme magical power? Does He attain the state of bodilessness? [Teach] me [His] limbs as the ontic levels, right now! 
 [.5]O Lord of Gods, where do I see you? Of what kind—what is your form? How is [your] supreme magical power—of what sort is your power? Does He attain the state of bodilessness? He is without body, [yet] it is seen that He has a body. [Teach] me [His] limbs as the ontic levels, right now! What are the ontic levels of your body? Explain to me such things, o Lord, right now!
[.6]Because your words are about to be manifested, the moon (dhūm\-ra\-bhā) arises in [my] body. May your compassion be manifested! Tell me about the state of extinction! 
 [.7]The reason why such is the speech of the Lord [is that], when I perceive the words of the Lord, it is not a matter of doubt that they will cause pleasure, like the light of the moon. Teach me about the state of extinction. Teach me about the state of release. Because your compassion is going to be manifested. Because of the compassion of the Lord.
[.8]O best[Lord] of sages, my speech [about] what is earthly and what is non-earthly [should be listened] by you. This supreme state of isolation, empty, is the union [with the Lord] in the state of bodilessness. 
 [.9]There is the station called the ‘state of isolation’, the obtainment of bodilessness.
[.10]Earth▷ 3.45-52 is fivefold, solid, characterised by hardness. It is the beginning of the chief constituents of the body, consisting of flesh, nerves, etc. 
 [.11]The qualities of the Earth are five: smell, taste, form, touch, and sound. Its existence is permanent. Its characteristic is hardness. It produces the chief constituents of the body: flesh, bones, muscles. That was their former state.
[.12]Then▷ 3.45-52 there is Water, having four qualities, characterised by smell and touch, as well as form, taste, urine and so on. It is the supreme embodiment of the life principle, auspicious. 
 [.13]The qualities of Water are taste, form, smell, touch. Its characteristics are to melt and to flow. Blood, urine, and sweat are the first of them [among the five existing in the body]. Its essential nature is the Holy Soul. It (i.e., water) serves as its embodiment. It is supreme.
[.14]One▷ 3.45-52 knows the Brilliant (i.e., Fire) as having three qualities. It is hot, characterized by redness. It is accompanied by desire, anger, etc. It is the fire of the body, eminent. 
 [.15]The qualities of Fire are three: form, touch, and sound. Its qualities are fever and self-conceit. Desire and anger are their precursors. That is the fire of the body. It is eminent.
[.16]The▷ 3.45-52 Wind is said to be twofold indeed, characterised by touch and sound. It is the breath, whose essence is the life-principle, eternal. It is the mind of all the embodied beings. 
 [.17]Such is the Wind, its qualities are two: touch and sound. It is shaky. Its characteristic is movement. Its essential nature is the life-principle. Its existence is permanent. It serves as the consciousness of the body.
[.18]The▷ 3.45-52 Space has one quality. It is well established in the body. It is contained in the orifices of both ears, in the nostrils, etc. 
 [.19]Such is the Space, its quality is one: sound. It is placed in all the orifices of your body. The orifices of your nose are the first among them.
[.20]The▷ 3.45-52▷ ubhayatmakacomm manas is double in essence, o Hero, i.e. ideation towards this or that [element]. First the visible is meditated upon, then the invisible. Thus the mind disappears, [having become] supreme, beyond the senses, and empty. 
 [.21]The excellent [state] should be spoken about thus. The activities of the manas are two. It forms ideations for all the things. How is that? As follows: first, one meditates upon the material [world]; in the end, one reflects upon the immaterial. All the connected organs are thus. The Five Gross Elements and the manas, they are the connected organs. In view of the fact that they are the causes % of the Organs, that is the reason why they are called Subtle Organs. Further, the manas is without conflicting thoughts towards all the objects when it is empty.
[.22]The Sense-Mind should meditate on the great void, Śiva, the imperishable state of isolation, [which] becomes visible by means of the Sense-Mind. [Then, the meditator] will perpetually abide in the state of bodilessness. 
 [.23]In this occasion, the learned master meditates upon the stage of the void. It is called ‘Śiva’; it is called the ‘state of isolation’, without end. In the end, it is turned into a visible form by the Sense-Mind. When he has finished to meditate upon the state of the void, his abode is the state of bodilessness, perpetually.
[.24]What will become of the superior mind that is appeased? [It will be] empty, extremely subtle. But [were it] not so because of exceeding sin, he should meditate on the void in visible form. 
 [.25]The station of the void, its subtlety is extreme. Even though [the yogin’s mind] is free from disturbance, this [supreme state] is not met even once due to the abundance of his sin. In this case, the learned master should meditate; its supreme [nature] should be made clearly visible.
[.26]Having seen the paramount [light] that exists within [the body], he should fix the \manasmind\ [on it]. 
 [.27]If he meditates, the light that is within is seen by him. It is called †rayasthāli†. When it is seen, he should fix the Sense-Mind on it by way of his attention.
[.28]The▷ paramanu atomic individual and the infinitesimal particle [in the heart] have the splendour of melted gold. [That light] acquires a visible form by way of them, having a splendour equal to ten million suns. 
 [.29]The light is like gold that has been inflamed. Its splendour is equal to a thousand suns. That is turned into a visible form by all the paramāṇus.
[.30]Having▷ 5.15 cast the gaze inside the heart, what is made of tamas is dissolved again. A divine light is in his own body, eight fingers’ breadth inside the head. 
 [.31]The tamas is in the heart. At last it is dissolved into the atoms. When this happens, it is together with the splendour of the divine light in the body. Eight fingers is its measure in the interior of the head.
[.32]In this way he may see the state of bodilessness, above, whose visible mark is the void. It is the station perpetually immaterial, imperishable, endowed with Śiva [divided] into eight [forms]. 
 [.33]When this happens, the learned master sees the state of being bodiless, there in the light. Its form is [as follows]: the void is the characteristic of the reverend Eightfold Śiva. It goes higher and higher. There is the ‘immaterial station’. It is the station of the Absolute. Its clarity is extreme. There is no desire in it.
[.34]He will see the shining void—shining and pure in the entire body, shining even in the Space [in it]—through a Sense-Mind free from activity. 
 [.35]The likeness of the excellent station is as follows: at last, it is an immaculate void in the entire body. It is immaculate even in the Space [in it]. That is seen by him by means of his Sense-Mind, fixed without being busy towards other [objects].
[.36][He will see that void] within all the [remaining] Elements—Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind, in the middle, above, and below, as well as in the ten cardinal and intermediate directions. 
 [.37]The nature of that station is to go upwards and downwards in layers. It is visible through all the Five Gross Elements. Its form is within the Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Space, and in the cardinal and intermediate directions of space.
[.38]Wherever one observes attentively, [that supreme station] is obtained there. Having abandoned the Sense-Mind, he enters into that [station], pure and without any desires whatsoever 
 [.39]If any of those loci is looked at by him, a Sense-Mind that is extremely pure is obtained by him. [It] will never be affected by desire.
[.40]The proffering of the syllables a etc. in the state of absorption produces the supreme station. After [the syllables] at the end and at the beginning are generated, he should impose the seed-syllables at once. 
 [.41]I shall speak to you, o Hero, as follows: absorption is the yoga of the syllable a: oṁ aṁ namaḥ. Absorption is the syllable u: oṁ uṁ namaḥ. The endless ordinance is the yoga of the syllable ma: oṁ maṁ namaḥ. The uninterrupted absorption is the yoga of the syllable oṁ: oṁ oṁ namaḥ. The Leader among Ascetics should impose them [onto the body].
[.42]Thereupon, the superior extinction, the supreme station of extinction, [arises]. It is said to be extinction of the deliberating activity of the manas, as well as the Ten Organs. 
 [.43]When, at last, there is the state of release, supreme in exceptional measure, the Leader among Yogins will obtain [it]. Suddenly, the Sense-Mind is extinguished; in such a state, the Sense-Mind disappears, and also its organs. [It] ceases to form concepts.
[.44]This [supreme station] is devoid of all the Sovereign Powers, pure, supremely spotless. It provides the Space for everything that exists, whether in the Earth or in the Water. 
 [.45]When [the Sense-Mind] ceases to form concepts, it is pure. Its clarity is supreme. It is abandoned by the supernatural qualities of the state of Sovereignty. As for everything that exists, it is in the Space, in the Earth, in the Water.
[.46]He knows that everything exists in the Fire and the Wind, divine. Having beheld that unique [reality], void, he should maintain the daily necessary rites at all times. 
 [.47]It is known by the learned master that all the beings reside in the Fire and in the Wind. They are divine. The [supreme] station is seen by him. When it is seen, it is meditated upon with the Sense-Mind at all times.
[.48]One who is wise, one without knowledge, or even an ignorant one [achieves] the vision [of that reality] in a depopulated place or even in a public congregation [when] the manas’s ideation is constantly unbewildered and independent thanks to the gnosis. 
 [.49]The supreme station is seen by him. Whether in a public congregation or in an empty place, it is reached. The clear Sense-Mind is seen in its steadfastness towards the void, because of the supreme gnosis.
[.50]Having entered the imperishable void, the universe disappears: Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Mahādeva, the syllable oṁ, and the Eightfold Śiva. 
 [.51]The station of the void is reached by him. It is without end. All the deities disappear, carried along in the void. What are they like? As follows: Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Mahādeva, the Eightfold Śiva, and the syllable oṁ.
[.52]When there is the sight of an apparition of pre-death omens, the vital breath should enter into the void. The great universe is seen as void: the manas should enter into [that void] with effort. 
 [.53]When he sees the pre-death omens of all the gods, he should enter into the void. And the alerted manas, it is visible and invisible: its appearance is void, non-existence. That is what he should also enter into.
[.54]The consciousness dwells within the void. The manas is constantly without perception. Whether bewildered or not bewildered, the manas is fixed on the void. 
 [.55]The Sense-Mind and the consciousness, they constantly seek disappearance in the void. Further, [whether they are] with ideation or without ideation, they should be caused to penetrate the void.
[.56]Then▷ udbhrantapattracommentary [the Sense-Mind obtains] the station of liberation because of God, like a leaf scattered by the wind. In such a manner, dissolving in the body spontaneously, it becomes pure spontaneously. 
 [.57]In the end, when the Sense-Mind is released, it is like a leaf whirled around and blown by the wind. Such is the spontaneous (svayam) station in the body. It is pure spontaneously. It is excellent spontaneously.
[.58][There▷ rainbowbody is] the spontaneous production [of enlightenment] in the sky: the spontaneous [state of enlightenment] is a pure rainbow. The Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ, Svar, Mahā, Janaḥ, Tapas, and Satya are above it. Having abandoned all [those worlds, the yogin] proceeds to the supreme void, the supreme extinction. 
 [.59]The spontaneous station, when it arises in the space, is like a rainbow; it is pure. bhurloka, bhuvarloka, svarloka, Mahāloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Satya\-lo\-ka: there are worlds above it. All those worlds should be left behind by the Leader among Yogins. In the end he obtains the station of extinction. Its nature is void and supreme.
[.60]Even▷ 1.9 the Sense-Mind that is altered by the objects of the Sixteen Evolutes [of Nature], and that is tormented by the bad deeds of the past, henceforth becomes pure and empty. 
 [.61]The manas that is bewildered because of the objects of the Sixteen Evolutes, that performed evil deeds in former times, and that is in a disturbed state, even in such a condition, it [becomes] pure, and as a result enters into the void.
[.62]Whatever sin, killing a Brahmin in the first place; the binding by the defilements, desire in the first place; the great world, [formed by] the ontic levels from Earth to Space: [all this enters] extinction. 
 [.63]The sins, killing a Brahmin in the first place; the experience of defilements, desire in the first place; all the ontic levels, beginning with Earth; the Seven Worlds, Bhuḥloka in the first place, are dissolved by way of the reality of extinction when it is engaged at last.
[.64]When the Sense-Mind [becomes] the station of the void, all the ontic levels [are extinguished] without remainder. When the mind reaches the state of emptiness, [they become] spontaneously pure and immaculate to the highest degree. 
 [.65]In this condition, all the ontic levels will be entirely annihilated. When they are annihilated, they obtain the station of emptiness. They [become] by themselves extremely spotless at the time when the Sense-Mind obtains the emptiness.
[.66]There is the Intellect that exists, the Intellect that exists and does not exist, and beyond that, the Intellect that does not exist. The Intellect that is non-existent is the end of the ‘instrument’; the Intellect that is absolutely not non-existent is the unpolluted. 
 [.67]The Intellect that exists, it exists; its seed-syllable is Aghora: oṁ aṁ namaḥ. The Intellect that exists and does not exist, it exists and does not exist; its seed-syllable is Gāyatrī: oṁ taṁ namaḥ. The Intellect that does not exist, it does not exist. Its seed-syllable is Vaiṣṇavī: oṁ saṁ namaḥ. The Intellect that is non-existent, it does not exist. Its seed-syllable is Raudrikā: oṁ baṁ namaḥ. The Intellect that is absolutely not non-existent, it exists without coming to an end, without flowing [away]. Its seed-syllable is Brāhmī: oṁ iṁ namaḥ.
[.68]There is the excellent fivefold state, every state [of which] is taught to be supreme. Thus is one’s natural state (svapada) as the syllable oṁ, [in which] the Sense-Mind is extinguished, pure. 
 [.69]Thus are the five states. They are supreme. All the states, they should be taught. Such is the state of extinction of the Sense-Mind when it is pure. It is the syllable oṁ, the place of the reverend Eightfold Śiva.
[.70]The Intellect that exists is called waking. [The Intellect that] exists and does not exist is called dream. The Intellect that does not exist is called deep sleep. [The Intellect that] is absolutely non-existent is called the Fourth [State]. 
 [.71]The Intellect that exists, it is the state of waking. It is taught by the learned master to be unfit. Its seed-syllable is Aghora: oṁ aṁ namaḥ. The Intellect that exists and does not exist, it is the dreaming state. Its seed-syllable is Gāyatrī: oṁ taṁ namaḥ. The Intellect that does not exist, it is the state of deep sleep. Its seed-syllable is Vaiṣṇavī: oṁ saṁ namaḥ. The Intellect that is absolutely non-existent, it is called the Fourth State. Its seed-syllable is Raudrī: oṁ baṁ namaḥ.
[.72]The Intellect that is absolutely not non-existent is the Supreme Brahman, the syllable oṁ, void and immaculate. 
 [.73]The Intellect that is absolutely not non-existent is the Supreme Brahman. Its seed-syllable is Brāhmī: oṁ iṁ namaḥ. The syllable oṁ is void, without end.
[.74]Having visualized the supreme extinction, a man will obtain the pure station. If he is sleeping, he is held back, for his consciousness is in pain. 
 [.75]Further, the course of action of the learned master should be to meditate on the state of extinction. It is supreme. Once he finishes doing so, he obtains the pure state of the entire world. For the man, if he will fall asleep, will be covered by strife (vigraha), and his consciousness will experience suffering.
 [.76]†All human beings ... there being the slow fall of tears from the eyes ... adversity like the secret parts of a horse ... † 
 [.77]The heart of all human beings is perplexed by their longings, as they hold the tears in their eyes; they are perplexed and in restless movement. Such is their likeness. They clatter like the sulapit of a horse.
[.78]He will not see because of all sorts of pain; [yet,] he should look at this Supreme Śiva. [He] will slowly become visible in the disk of the sun, burning to the highest degree. 
 [.79]In this circumstance, all pains are seen. Even so, the Lord Śiva should be looked at. He is not affected by suffering. He is Supreme. When he has finished to visualize the Lord, the burning circle of the reverend Sun should be looked at by him. The manner in which he looks should be gradual.
[.80]If the man is distressed because of the pain, [he should keep looking at] the station of the void slowly. Having perceived [that,] he is not enveloped in sickness [when] the Lord in embodied form (deha\-mūr\-tī\-śa) is experienced. 
 [.81]Even though he is suffering because of the pain, the station of the void should be looked at by him. His manner [of looking] should be slow; [he should] not let it be hasty. He should not be perturbed by the perception of the Supreme.
[.82]The moon, having entered into thick clouds, †sandhasuniśa† ... immaculate: thus is the excellent extinction, the perfectly spotless void. 
 [.83]His image is like the splendour of the moon covered by thick clouds. Further, the state of liberation is supreme and void. Its clarity is perfect. Evaṁ—thus is its appearance.
[.84]The individual Soul, having departed from the elemental body, obtains that [state described above] as such. In this way, o Hero, the imperishable state of closeness to the void [is obtained] at last. 
 [.85]For what is called body, the holy Soul is what is left of it. When this happens, he enters the station that has been spoken about before. Having arrived at the station, the holy Soul dwells in the void without end.
[.86][It is] endowed with the supernatural quality of all the sovereign powers, brilliant like a myriad suns. Sin is destroyed by the gnosis, and the body melted like the night [by the sun]. 
 [.87]At the moment when the holy Soul is released from the body, it obtains the supernatural quality of all the sovereign powers. It is like the brilliance of a myriad suns. Its sin is destroyed by way of the gnosis. a u ma oṁ: such is the gnosis by means of which sins disappear.
[.88]As long as [the Soul] moves for the sake of existence, all the human beings are overpowered. It moves in human beings according to inclination, and it is the organ of sense of the Supreme Reality. 
 [.89]The holy Soul is in the human beings. It is like a reflection. All human beings are overpowered by it. In the end it becomes its desired object. Its characteristic while it blends with the human beings is that it obtains the state of excellence, whose forms are three: the generator, the destructor, he who overpowers the human beings. Such are the three.
[.90][Having spent] many hundreds of thousands of aeons in the city of Brahman, [the Soul] obtains this station of Brahman, and is praised as a knower of the Brahmamantras. 
 [.91]When it obtains the three [states mentioned above], it reaches the station of Brahman. Several hundreds of thousands of aeons is the length of time during which it stays there. At the end of its stay in the city of Brahman, it reaches the end of the Brahmaloka. Such is the station that I have spoken about, concerning the state of excellence of one who knows the Brahmamantras.
[.92][He is] not one possessing little knowledge, [but] the whole of it, [having obtained] the divine state of liberation and [having become] the Lord of the universe. In that state, he desires to obtain extinction, this supreme and intensely blissful [state]. 
 [.93]Thus are all of them there [in that state]. They are omniscient. They are the kings of the entire universe while they are in the station of Brahman. In the end, they obtain the state of liberation, being unaffected by pleasure and pain, as well as the cycle of rebirth. They are supreme.
[.94]Having meditated on [the station that] has been mentioned before, the ascetic will immediately proceed to the void, †...† The supreme knowledge of the syllable oṁ. 
 [.95]Thus is the progression of the holy Soul. Therefore, the course of action of the practitioner is to meditate on the praṇava. [It] has already been taught previously. Let not it be protracted. He reaches the station of the void: his form is like a lightning, existing [for an instant then suddenly] disappearing. The blissful extinction is obtained by him.
[.96]The▷ rainbowbody pacified [state] is like a clear lamp, like a clear rainbow; it is manifold and uninterrupted. By way of it, extinction [is obtained, consisting in] the conglomeration [and dissolution] of the elements. 
 [.97]The appearance of the state of extinction is like the flare of a bright lamp; its form is like a clear rainbow. That is the unification of the Five Gross Elements, when their many forms manifest themselves.
[.98]As for this divine body, it is easy [to obtain]; easily he will proceed toward extinction. O Hero, this secret of existence, the beginning, middle, and end of it, I shall now proclaim in its entirety to you, o great-souled one. 
 [.99]For generating a divine body is easy; the state of liberation is easy. Those are obtained by the learned master. Such a gnosis, it is the secret of existence. I will tell you that in its beginning and middle, as well as its end. I [will] teach you completely, for it is supreme. Thus will be my speech to you, o Hero.
[.100]Since [the master] has drank the unequalled esoteric teaching, [the pupil should be] a believer, one who has subdued the senses, virtuous, not low-spirited, and devoted to the teacher at all times. 
 [.101]The supreme esoteric teaching has been drunk by the learned master. That is the reason why the conduct of the pupil should be faith[ful]: he should follow the particular code of the teacher, and should never be tired of carrying out observances. That is devotion toward the teacher. Such is the behaviour of the pupil. He should not be disobedient toward the teacher. The teacher should not bestow [the teaching] upon a man who is without devotion toward the teacher.
[.102][The esoteric teaching] is not to be given to one who is ignorant in the Vedas and the Śāśtras, who is selfish, unrestrained, querulous, not carrying out observances, poor, of low birth, ignoring the rules, or a slander. 
 [.103]If the pupil is not knowledgeable in the sacred literature, he is not to be granted it by him. If the pupil is selfish and disrespectful toward the guru, he is not to be granted it by him. If the pupil is strongly intoxicated by palm wine and the state of drunkenness is constant, he is not to be granted it. If the pupil does not carry out the observances, he is not to be granted it. If the pupil is in a pitiable condition, he is not to be granted it. Further, if he is of low birth, he is not to be granted it. If the pupil disregards the rules, he is not to be granted it. If the pupil commits slander toward the guru, he is not to be granted it.
[.104][The master] desires to bestow [the teaching] to [a pupil] who is obedient to the guru and respecting the religious duties, filled with devotion for the guru, whose goal is the worship of the guru’s feet, truthful. 
 [.105]To a pupil who is obedient to the guru, and who loves the secret code of duty [that is] the instruction of the guru, whose tranquil mind and great devotion have as goal the worship of the feet of the guru, a pupil who is always attending to the personal work of the guru, who loves to carry out religious austerities—to such a pupil the guru should be willing to teach the secret code of duty.
[.106]This▷ bhuvanasarira teaching has been spoken by me, the supreme and auspicious secret doctrine about the world and the body. He who knows it will reach Śiva. 
 [.107]The doctrine that has been told by me is supreme and truly auspicious, being the secret [doctrine] of the world and the body. It should be known by the practitioner. He who knows about the doctrine, as it is called, surely reaches the station of the Lord, as taught by the reverend sage Bhārgava and the reverend {\rdc}ṣis, Siddhas, and Munis who all together study the sacred texts with the Lord. 
 [.108]Thus [ends] the scripture entitled ‘The Storehouse of the Worlds’, the Secret Doctrine on Brahman, Chapter 5. 
    
\normalsize{oṁ, Hail to the Mountain-Lord! [.1]†...†
 [.2]The cause of what is designated as being mature (matuhā) is: one should not be careless towards the scriptures of the Siddhānta, so that he is not sinful.
[.3]How much more a person who is deluded, devoid of knowledge, uncultivated, poor, without good conduct, without bodily vigour and yogic heat. 
 [.4]And also, a deluded person, who does not possess the gnosis, who is without good conduct, who does not perform the donation of wealth, who is not of youth, who is not of austerity—do not think that he will not incur in sin!
[.5]By means of that gnosis, o Skanda, he is known to be more mature than the mature—not because of the long moustaches [and] hair, not because of birth as a person of white complexion. 
 [.6]To sum up: the wise one, he is fully intent on the Siddhānta-Gnosis. He is truly mature, for he is mature because of his gnosis. Likewise, o my son reverend Kumāra, it is not one whose moustaches are long, not one who is surpassing others in age, not one whose hair are long, not one whose hair are shaved and gleaming, not a person whose birth is high who is designated as mature.
[.7]One may learn all the scriptures [and yet, if] he abandons the supreme gnosis, he will not find even [an inferior] gnosis; alas, he is beguiled by illusion. 
 [.8]There is a practitioner who studies all the scriptures. The Holy Supreme Siddhānta is abandoned by him. He will not find even [an inferior] gnosis, such a practitioner does not experience My gnosis. Alas, he is beguiled by illusion, for he is in the power of My beguilement. 
[.9]What is superior to all the scriptures—there is a scripture that is superior to all scriptures—is the Supreme Siddhānta-Gnosis, its superiority is the Holy Sid\-dhān\-ta-Gnosis. If a man learns it [while he is] in the world, if there is a man who studies the Holy Siddhānta-Gnosis in the world, his life is successful, his life is successful while he is in the world. Thus is the word of the Lord. 
[.10]Here in this world, o Great Goddess, if the great happiness is obtained by him during [his] time in this world. In the afterworld he will attain Śiva­hood: in the future, when he becomes united with the Lord Śiva indeed. 
[.11]Thus these right [statements have been spoken]. This is the end of My teachings to you, o Goddess. They truly are exceedingly right. There is no doubt, o fair-faced one: he who knows such gnosis does not suffer; thus, o Goddess, do not be doubtful toward the teachings. Thus all these statements [have been spoken], o excellent son: likewise, o my son, reverend Kumāra, do not be doubtful about any of My teachings to you. 
[.12]The knower of the Truth does not reveal. The form prakāśati is used here as the equivalent of the causative prakāśayati. the Gnosis. Further, what the knower of the Truth should do [with] this Holy Siddhānta-Gnosis that has been spoken about, o Goddess, [is as follows:] The secret doctrine, let it not be uttered by you! It should not be communicated to a villainous human being. If you wish to communicate the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis, [it should be to] one who will be able to follow the custom of the offering to the guru. If [the disciple gives] one-fifth [of his] wealth, two pieces of gold and a quarter, in that case, he may be given the holy Jñānasiddhānta by the learned master.
 [.13]Thus [ends] the Scripture on the Siddhānta-Gnosis, Chapter 1.
    [.1] 
[.2]The production, maintenance and dissolution of the external [reality]: The holy dot, that I shall teach you, o Goddess, and also its deities—Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Īśvara.
[.3]manas, Intellect, and Self-Identity is called production. Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva is called production. 
 [.4]The reverend Brahmā is the manas. The reverend Viṣṇu is the Intellect. The reverend Śiva is the Self-Identity. That is how production looks like, [as] taught by the learned master.
[.5]The Intellect, Self-Identity, and manas: that is called maintenance. Likewise, Śiva, Brahmā, and Viṣṇu is called maintenance. 
 [.6]Their manifestation during maintenance is as follows: the reverend Śiva is the Intellect. The reverend Brahmā is the Self-Identity. The reverend Viṣṇu is the manas. Thus is how their maintenance looks like.
[.7]Self-Identity, manas, and Intellect is called dissolution. Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva is called dissolution. 
 [.8]The way their dissolution looks like is as follows: the reverend Viṣṇu is the Self-Identity. The reverend Brahmā is the Intellect. The reverend Śiva is the manas. Thus is how they look like during dissolution, [as] taught by the learned master.
[.9]The u dissolves into the a, the a is dissolved into the ma; the ma is dissolved into the dot (bindu). 
 [.10]Thus is the reality of the holy dot, [as it is] reabsorbed internally. The holy u is dissolved into the holy a. The holy a is dissolved into the holy ma. The holy ma is dissolved into the dot. The method of the production-maintenance-dissolution is as follows: uṁ aṁ maṁ.
[.11]The▷ 7.6 syllable oṁ is recognised as Rudra, and Umā as svāhā; u is svāhā, Brahmā is the syllable oṁ. The intelligent one should mutter [the mantra] svāhāpati (i.e., Agni/Fire). 
 [.12]The reality of the holy syllable oṁ is as follows: if the reverend Rudra is the syllable oṁ, the holy u is Umā. If the reverend Brahmā is the syllable oṁ, the holy syllable u is svāhā. That is called ‘man and wife’. It should be known by the learned masters.
[.13]This oṁ should come first, then, having [proffered:] the mantra and carried out the cleansing, one should make the ash-fist, [uttering:] ‘May the human being become Śiva!’ 
 [.14]At the beginning, he realizes the god of the syllable oṁ. Then his action should be the cleansing of the hands, along with its mantra. When he has finished doing so, he should perform the ash-fist, and the transformation into Śiva.
[.15]The oṁ is the eater of the offerings (i.e., Agni/fire), the fire-wood are the Brahma[mantra]-syllables, Umā is the flame, of great splendour, while the smoke is Rudra. 
 [.16]How is the ash processed by the learned master? As follows: the holy Brahmamantras stand for the wood. The holy syllable oṁ stands for the fire, which burns the wood. The Goddess Umā is the splendour of the fire. The Lord Rudra stands for the smoke.
[.17]All the seed-syllables [made by] the Brahma[mantra]-syllables, the fire, the syllable oṁ, ending with the svāhā: one should offer those as oblations [until they are] reduced to ashes, day after day. 
 [.18]The learned master knows about the performance of the holy ashes: that is why he worships the reverend Agni (i.e., the sacred fire). The seed-syllables stand for the holy Brahmamantras. Those are his means of worshiping the reverend Agni. The holy syllable oṁ together with the holy svāhā, those stand for the fire. They are worshiped by the learned master. [They are] reduced to ashes by the reverend Fire [over] a long [period of] time. Those should be reduced to ashes by the learned master.
[.19]The ashes should be known as the syllable oṁ. Viṣṇu is known as the water. Agni is known as Brahmā. Because he has known [thus, he will obtain] liberation, without doubt. 
 [.20]How is the form of the holy ashes? As follows: The sacred oṁ is the ashes. The reverend Viṣṇu is the water. The reverend Brahmā is the fire. His liberation is without any remainder whatsoever.
[.21]Brahmā is manifested as the palm. Viṣṇu is the fore part [of the hand]. Śiva should be known as all the fingers. He will eventually reach the abode that is the final liberation 
 [.22]Here is what should be known by he who desires [to obtain] the abode of the Lord: the reverend Brahmā is in the palm. He is visible there. The reverend Viṣṇu is the fore part [of the hand]. The reverend Śiva is in all the fingers. The knowledge of the practitioner about the reality of the holy ashes of Śiva, along with their emplacement [on the hand], is easy indeed.
[.23]Śiva is declared to be the ash, and the palm the altar. The fingers are known as the firewood. The lines are the maṇḍala. 
 [.24]The holy ashes of Śiva should be known by the practitioner: the altar is in the palm; the fingers are the firewood; the lines of the palm are the lotus-maṇḍala.
[.25]He should divide the head into five parts, and proffer the fivefold mantra. sa is in the East, ba in the South. The clever one should place the ta in the West. 
 [.26]The holy ashes of Śiva should be divided into five parts by him, and the [ap\-pro\-pri\-ate] mantra should be uttered by him: sa pūr (Sadyojāta-East), ba da (Bāmadeva-South), ta pa (Tatpuruṣa-West). 
[.27]The abode of Aghora is in the North. a u (Aghora-North). Īśāna is on the top. [Its mantra is] i, in the fontanel. The face of Śiva is on the top of the liṅga. In the liṅga in the face, there is the Lord Śiva, and also on \arrowrightx the top. The man should erect those which have been seen [in this manner]. Those are the six limbs of the Lord Śiva. They should be erected at the top [of the head]. It is there that the deities of the main and intermediate directions of the compass should be erected by the practitioner. How do they look like? As follows: 
 [.28]One should recognize Īśvara as the face in the East (pūrvāsya), Brahmā as the face of the South, Mahādeva [as the face that is] in the West, [and] the face of Viṣṇu [to be] in the North. 
 [.29]The reverend Īśvara is in the East. Brahmā is in the South. Mahādeva is the face of the Lord of the West. The reverend Viṣṇu is the face of the Lord in the North. Thus are the emplacements of the deities of the main and intermediary directions. The practitioner should apply the ashes in this precise manner. As follows is another [manner to apply ashes]:
[.30][He] should apply at all times that ash on the hump, on the forehead, on the throat, on the arms, on the heart, on the breasts, on the belly, on the navel, on the buttocks, and on the feet. 
 [.31]Hump, forehead, throat, both arms, heart, both breasts, belly, navel, back, both feet: such are [the bodily parts] anointed with ashes by the practitioner. He applies the ashes everyday.
[.32]Everything is purified by ashes, even one who has fallen into an animal birth. Indeed, thanks to those [ashes], those continually [reborn as] grass and plants attain the purity of body. 
 [.33]If the practitioner constantly employs ashes, that is the reason why his body will become pure by means of the holy ashes. Further, those who are born as animals, grass, trees, all of them are released by means of the holy ashes.
[.34]Having made use of them, all the gods, along with the Daityas, Asuras, and human beings, as well as the Siddhas and Cāraṇas along with their followers obtain release by means of the ashes. 
 [.35]Further, all the deities and the Daityas, the Dānavas and the human beings, along with the Siddhas and Cāraṇas in the first place, as well as the ensemble of the[ir] followers, they are all liberated by means of those holy ashes of Śiva.
[.36]Those who carry out observances live on those ashes strenuously, carrying the topknot and the garment of tree-bark; they carry out meritorious acts at all times. 
 [.37]Thus is the divine quality of the holy ashes of Śiva. That is why the Leader among Yogins should be dedicated to carry out the observance of the holy ashes of Śiva.
[.38]The ashes are turned into a daily means of livelihood. [The yogin] endowed with devotion towards Śiva partakes of non-separation because of the conjunction between the river and the ocean. 
 [.39]If the yogin continuously uses the holy ashes of Śiva as means of livelihood, he is united with Śiva, possessing the state of oneness with the Lord Śiva, like the union of the lightning and the ocean.
[.40]The syllable oṁ is to be known as the Spirit, the svāhā is regarded as the Nature. The syllable oṁ is called Viṣṇu, the svāhā is celebrated in the world as Śrī. 
 [.41]What is the reason why the learned master is united [with the Lord] by way of turning the holy ashes of Śiva as means of livelihood? As follows: the holy syllable oṁ is the Spirit, the holy svāhā is the Nature. The Lord Viṣṇu is the syllable oṁ; the Goddess Śrī is the svāhā. She is famous in the world as being such. [These correspondences] should be known by the learned masters.
[.42]Likewise, Brahmā is the syllable oṁ, svāhā is Sāvitrī, [his] wife. 
 [.43]If the reverend Brahmā is the syllable oṁ, Sāvitrī is the svāhā. The reason why the holy ashes of Śiva are special is as follows:
[.44]The▷ 7.23 Lord Viṣṇu is the sa, the ma is the Lord Śiva, the bha is the Lord Brahmā. One reality becomes threefold. 
 [.45]Such is the reason why the holy ashes of Śiva are special. The reverend Tri\-sa\-ma\-ya is in the ashes: the Lord Viṣṇu is the sa, the Lord Śiva is the ma, the Lord Brahmā is the bha. Thus is their nature as the three become\ one.
[.46]The syllable bha creates the world. The ma destroys the creatures. The sa protects the world. They are one in nature [while being] individually distinct. 
 [.47]Thus are their manifestations: the bha creates the world. The ma destroys the beings. The sa protects the world. Thus is the manifestation of the one being different.
[.48]Production is the Lord Brahmā, maintenance is Viṣṇu, dissolution is the Lord Rudra—the threefold refuge of the Three Worlds. 
 [.49]The Lord Brahmā is production. The Lord Viṣṇu is maintenance. The Lord Rudra is dissolution. Thus are the three serving as the refuge of the worlds.
[.50]What are called production, maintenance, and dissolution are the abodes of the gods, beginning with Brahmā etc. May the knower of reality be without desire for the permanent and impermanent worlds. 
 [.51]What is the appearance of the world? It resorts to the three. Thus are all the worlds, their forms are nityānitya: their natures are lasting and non-lasting. The production, maintenance, and dissolution: the reverend Brahmā is the first among them. That is why the knower of reality has no desire towards the world.
[.52]Brahmā is the creation of the world. Viṣṇu is the preserver. Rudra is the destroyer of the world, [including] mankind as well as animate and inanimate beings. 
 [.53]The reverend Brahmā creates the world. The reverend Viṣṇu protects the creatures. The Lord Rudra destroys the world. The mankind and the movable and immovable beings, they are destroyed by the reverend Rudra.
[.54]O Goddess, I am the extraction of the mantra, with the syllable oṁ as the first [unit], paramount. O fair-faced one, know that at the top of [My] body is the vaṣaṭ. 
 [.55]This mantra, o Goddess, is my body. And the mantra vaṣaṭ is placed at the top. You should know that, o Goddess.
[.56]As long as a human being lives, o Goddess, [he should endeavour] to [obtain] a pure embodiment by means of ashes. Once he has left behind the body, he is released, [even after] a million of births. 
 [.57]The meaning of becoming a human being is that, as long as one is alive, that is the reason why one’s body should be purified by means of the ashes. In the same way is the body when it is left behind by one’s own life principle, for the body is released at last, even if he were to undertake the continuous practice of the holy ashes of Śiva during millions of rebirths in order not to be affected by sin, which has as fruit the purity of his body.
[.58]Whether one is a male or even a hermaphrodite, a female, a foreigner, or a śūdra, because of having constantly known the ashes, o Goddess, he/she goes to Śiva after leaving [the body]. 
 [.59]Human beings who practice with the holy ashes of Śiva, whatever is their kind\newline—whether a male or an eunuch, whether a woman or a śūdra or a being of low status—all of them, o Goddess, if they know the holy ashes of Śiva in the right manner, when their body is abandoned by the holy life principle, they—the human beings who know the reality of the ashes—reach the station of Śiva.newline \ \\
 [.60]Thus [ends] the Scripture on the Material Ritual for the \mbox{Ash-Mantra, Chapter 2.
    [.1] God spoke: TheLord discussion of the holy ashes of Śiva, which has been spoken about to you, o Goddess, is finished. Now I shall teach you another [topic:] the fruit of the daily cleansing.
[.2]O Goddess, the fruit of the cleansing with leaves, if [performed] everyday, is a thousand-fold; [that of] the cleansing with earth and water is a hundred thousand-fold and a million-fold [respectively]. 
 [.3]The leaves used as a means for the cleansing, their fruit is a thousand, if [used] everyday. The earth used as a means for the cleansing, its fruit is one hundred thousand. The water used as a means for the cleansing, its fruit is a million. 
[.4]The cleansing with ashes will give a fruit, and that fruit is a thousand times ten millions. The fruit of ashes being used as a means for the cleansing is as follows: its fruit is a thousand times ten millions. The cleansing with gnosis, [its fruits are] unlimited. There is a fifth [type] of cleansing: it is the cleansing with gnosis indeed, being superior to all the cleansings. Its fruits are unlimited. This would be my teaching to you, o Goddess.
[.5]The cleansing with leaves is the lowest. The [one with] earth is middling. [Higher] than those two is the cleansing with water; [higher] than those three are the ashes for the cleansing, o Goddess. 
 [.6]The sequence is as follows: the leaves used as a means for the cleansing would be the lowest. The earth used as a means for the cleansing would be middling. The water used as means for the cleansing would be the highest, because it is superior to those two. The ashes used as means for the cleansing are superior to those three.
[.7]Gnosis is the highest [means of] cleansing among those, known as more secret than the secret. One whose mind is free from sorrow would know all this carefully. 
 [.8]The leaves, earth, water, and ashes used as means of cleansing are lower than the cleansing through gnosis. Only the cleansing through gnosis is indeed the highest among them all, [more] secret than the secret. You should know that, o Goddess. Your manner to know that is that You should exert full attention towards that. Its goal, as it is known, is to bring the cycle of existence to an end. Thus were the words of the Lord to the Goddess.
 [.9]WhatGoddess is the seed-syllable of the ashes, when it is exoteric? Is the exoteric [form provided with] mantra or devoid of mantra? 
 [.10]The Goddess spoke: o Lord, with your permission, what is the form of the seed-syllable of the holy Ashes of Śiva, when the seed-syllable in it is exoteric? And, what is its mantra, if it is an exoteric mantra? Does it have a mantra, or is it without mantra? Thus [are my questions] about that [matter], with your permission. Thus were the words of the Goddess. The God spoke, his words were [as follows]:
[.11]The bha is the form of Brahmā, the sa is Viṣṇu. The ma is my very form. The praṇava is known as the three syllables. 
 [.12]The words of the Lord were as follows: The bha is the form of the reverend Brahmā. The sa is the form of the reverend Viṣṇu. The ma is the form of Īśvara. You should know that those three are Myself, o Goddess.
[.13]This praṇava that is [made of] ashes should be installed inside the body. [If] the material and immaterial ashes are known, there is no transmigration. 
 [.14]Where are those that are called ashes? He should join them with the body. Those are the material and immaterial ashes. Now, he who knows about them, he is called a liberated one.
[.15]The body of ashes is material. The body of gnosis is exceedingly immaterial. The one endowed with the gnosis is released because of the unity with the formless gnosis. 
 [.16]As follows are the material ashes: the body is the material ashes. The gnosis is the immaterial ashes. Further, what is the gnosis higher than the gnosis? He who knows about the ash-gnosis, he is released by way of the supreme gnosis.
[.17]He who carries out all sorts of actions, good and bad, and who knows everything about the ‘Compendium on the Ashes’, [achieves] even liberation, which is difficult to obtain. 
 [.18] That is the reason of the behaviour of he who knows the summary of the holy ashes. He is not discriminating with regard to his actions. Good and bad are carried out by him indeed, for the state of release is difficult to be obtained by way of them.
[.19]This gnosis, o Great Goddess, is superior to all the ontic levels. It is also secret and difficult to achieve, bestowing heaven as well as release. 
 [.20]The gnosis, o Goddess, is the highest among all the ontic levels. Further, it is difficult to be obtained. It is the cause of heaven and liberation.
[.21]He should bestow [this gnosis] against payment of one-fifth [of the disciple’s wealth], but not to a disciple who is not of service. Still, it should be bestowed upon a disciple who is peaceful and restrained, according to the rule. 
 [.22]Thus is the excellence of the holy gnosis, o Goddess. That is why you should not teach it to other people, or to a disciple who is not of service. How is the nature of a disciple who may be instructed in the gnosis? He is virtuous, his appearance and acts are good. In this case, the excellent gnosis should be given, together with the performance of prescribed ceremonies and offerings, etc.
[.23]The wise one should arrange open halls; having entered, he should instruct [the pupil about] the group of three: Spirit, the Lord, and [that which is] characterised by the Constituents (i.e. Nature) indeed. 
 [.24]How is the body of the gnosis? It is to be revealed as follows: the ‘Group of Three’ (trigaṇa) along with Tatpuruṣa and Īśāna. ‘The Group of Three’ means Sadyo[jāta], Bāma[deva], Aghora. As for Tatpuruṣa, [He is the] dot, [while] Īśāna [is] the resonance.
[.25]The praṇava is said to be ‘lumped together’ (piṇḍitam), adorned with the dot and the resonance. He who knows thus is not born again. Thus [he] instantly [obtains the state] that transcends the letters. 
 [.26]The coming together of them all is regarded as the syllable oṁ (praṇavākṣara). It contains the dot and the resonance. That should be known by the great master. If he knows about that, he does not come back to be born again. He does not incarnate and is not perceived in a material form by any sort of created beings. 
[.27]This very [praṇava] is the material gnosis. The holy praṇava is the material gnosis. This very [praṇava] is the heaven. The holy praṇava is the heaven. And if one mutters this gnosis. The holy praṇava, it should be known by the learned master. It should be muttered by him. Having known thus, he attains the state of release. Having used [the praṇava] for his muttering, he is released. 
[.28]Brahmā is to be known as the Nature (prak{\rd}ti). The wise one should know as follows: the reverend Brahmā is the Unevolved Matter (pradhāna). Viṣṇu is the Soul. The reverend Viṣṇu is the Soul. The Supreme Soul is Rudra. The Lord Rudra is the Supreme Soul. The Inner Soul is Sadāśiva. The reverend Sadāśiva is the Inner Soul. In the end, [there is the principle that is] subtle, without form. In the end, [there is] the reverend Paramaśiva, subtle, without a body. He is the one thought as the Supreme (parama): for that reason, He should be thought as the reverend Paramaśiva by the wise. 
[.29]Śivatama▷ sivatarasivatama is to be known as [higher] than Śiva. The reverend Śivatama is higher than the reverend Śiva. Śivatara is [higher] than Śiva[tama]. The reverend Śivatara is higher than the reverend Śivatama. Sadāśiva, o Goddess, is [higher] than Śiva[tara]. The revered Sadāśiva is higher than the reverend Śivatara. Paramaśiva is imperishable. The reverend Paramaśiva is higher than the reverend Sadāśiva. He is imperishable. 
[.30]The Supreme Śiva is in the resonance; the resonance is Īśāna Himself. The Reverend Paramaśiva resides in the resonance. He is Īśāna Himself. In the same manner, the seed-syllable of Sadāśiva, [i.e.] Tatpuruṣa, is in the dot. The reverend Sadāśiva resides in the dot. He is Tatpuruṣa Himself. 
[.31]The [half-]moon, which is the seed-syllable of Sadārudra, is Aghora Himself. The reverend Sadārudra resides in the half-moon (ardhacandra). It is Aghora Himself. Sadyojāta, o Skanda, [and the one] known to be simultaneously female and male. Vāmadeva and Sadya (i.e., Sadyojāta), they are Unevolved Matter and Spirit themselves. The two of them have to be remembered by the learned master together. 
[.32]Having known this secret doctrine. Therefore, the way of acting of he who knows the holy secret gnosis, o Goddess. That has been told by me to you, o fair-faced one. It should not be communicated. He will reach release, which is difficult to obtain by gods and human beings. As for the gods, Daityas, human beings, who know about the state of release, if they do not know about the holy teaching, they are not successfully released. But he who knows about the holy teaching, he [attains] liberation. [This is ] the meaning. 
[.33]From the resonance, the dot is produced. The dot is born from the resonance. The half-moon is produced from the dot. The half-moon arises from the dot. The origin of the universe is from that. The syllable oṁ arises from the half-moon. 
[.34]The universe dissolves into the [half-]moon. The syllable oṁ is dissolved into the half-moon. The [half-]moon dissolves into the dot. The half-moon is dissolved into the dot. The dot dissolves into the resonance. The dot is dissolved in the resonance. The resonance is dissolved in the immaterial. The resonance is dissolved in the immaterial. 
[.35]He Himself is supremely subtle, known as Śiva and Śivatama. He is Śiva, He is Śivatama. [He is] the God more immaterial than the immaterial, supreme, voider than the void. He is void[er] than the void. That is to say, He is the supreme void. 
[.36]He who knows about my body. If the wise one knows the body of Śiva, He enters into the Supreme Śiva. He reaches the station of the Lord Paramaśiva. He will attain the supreme bliss. He assumes the form of supreme bliss. Called the reality of Śiva. This which has been spoken about as the holy reality of Śiva. It is not revealed by the learned masters. It should not be communicated by the learned masters to others. 
[.37]The fool who reveals it. It should not be revealed to a foolish human being. If there is a stupid person who reveals the holy teaching of Siddhānta-Gnosis, He obtains hell. He certainly incurs in a sinful state. 
[.38]By [following] the▷ humdrutcommentary right order of the prescribed regimen, worship, and gestures [one will be reborn] among gods, demons, and human beings. The fruit of gestures and worship, together with the right order of the prescribed regimen, is [reincarnation as] a gods, demons, and human beings. Similarly, the fire-ritual and ashes [lead] to delusion. The man who performs the fire-ritual and uses ashes, if he does not know the gnosis of the Śaivasiddhānta, is a deluded one indeed. This mantra hūṁdhrūtkāram. The mantra hūṁdhrūtkāram. Is in the material [realm]; it is not immaterial. It is within the material realm; however, the immaterial is not so. All this, o Great Goddess. All this, o Goddess. Which bestows heaven, he who knows it because of delusion. If the practitioner is engrossed in gestures and worship, as well as mantras and the right order of the prescribed regimen, he obtains the fruit of heaven. He has heaven as his limit because of his ignorance about the immaterial gnosis. He is beguiled by My magical power. This kind of man, he is struck by My beguilement. To perform gestures, worship, and the prescribed regimen—The performance of gestures, worship, and the right order of the prescribed regimen—is an impediment for one desiring deliverance. That would be an impediment for he who desires deliverance. 
[.39]Similarly,▷ humdrutcommentary o Goddess, the salutation relates to the material body. For the salutation to the Lord, [Performed] as long as [one exists as a] human being [leads to] rebirth, it brings about rebirth. Here are those struck by my beguilement: Gods, demons, and human beings; Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara. Gods, Demons, human beings, and even Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara. All are beguiled by my illusion. All of them are struck by my beguilement. They are beguiled by your illusion. Like when they are struck by your illusion, o Goddess. 
[.40]He▷ humdrutcommentary who desires release, o Great Goddess. Therefore, the course of action of he who desires release [is as follows]: [He] Should abandon all [ritual] action. All the rituals, mudrās, worship, etc. should be abandoned by him, For as long as he is living in the world of darkness. For the entire span of his life as he exists in the world, he should abandon the darkness here in the heart. What should be abandoned? As follows is its likeness:
[.41]Mantras,▷ humdrutcommentary the [sound] hūṁdhrūt, the salutation, the gestures, the worship, the progression of the regimen, the ritual with the ashes and the sacred fire—all rituals [indeed], o fair-faced one. 
 [.42]As follows: the mantras, the sound hūṁdhrūt, and the salutation; the mudrās, the worship, the fire-ritual, all kinds of prescribed acts, as well as the actions with the ashes, and all the rituals, etc. All of them are not performed. All of them should not be performed. [They are a] bond for he who desires release. They are a bond for the state of release. He who desires release abandons them altogether. That is the reason why mudrās etc. should be abandoned by he who desires release. Once they have been abandoned, [He] enters into the Supreme Śiva. He reaches the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.43]All▷ humdrutcommentary the prescribed practices, [like] fire-rituals, worship, and the application of ashes, o six-faced one, mudrās, mantras, the salutation, hūṁdhrūt. For all of them, o my son Kumāra, Bestow heaven, not release. Their limit is heaven only; [they] do not obtain the state of release. His heart being addicted to those [practices], the adept fettered by the mantras. There is an adept who is addicted to mantras. Is then bewildered by liṅgas. Also, the constant practice of rituals relating to liṅgas. Is in the material; it is not immaterial. He obtains the material, without finding the immaterial, that is to say, without obtaining release. Likewise, the wise one should not recite the conglomerate-mudrā and the [conglomerate-]mantra. If the learned master is like that, he should not utter the conglomerate-mantra and the conglomerate-mudrā. This immaterial gnosis. However, the immaterial gnosis, that should be known by the yogin. It is the very abode of the supremely independent [absolute reality]. Therefore, the state of supreme independence should be know, for [in that state] the pleasure and pain have been carried away [for good]. The Goddess spoke: 
[.44]BeforeGoddess you have said that the breaths are portions of the Soul. The Soul has been communicated by the Lord to me before. What is their number? The breaths are its bodies, according to your words. Such words of yours, explain them to me according to the truth, my Lord!\\ God spoke: 
[.45]TheLord souls are the forms of Śiva. They are the forms of the Lord Śiva. They are many, o fair-faced one. Thus, their form is not single. Divine, they are made of light. Splendour serve as their body, eternally. They suffer, being distinct [individually]. They suffer; they are separated. 
[.46]O Great Goddess, one should reflect on the reality [of the souls] in order to enter Śiva. All of them, their reality is known by the yogin, here through the holy Śaivasiddhānta, o Goddess. The reason why he is not released [is the following:] The man who practices mudrās suffers through illusion because of his ignorance. Moreover, the adept who constantly practices mudrās, he is overpowered because of his ignorance. Therefore, the yogin should not perform [them]. 
[.47]Here, o Great Goddess, this unfathomable [gnosis] itself is the Supreme Śiva. Now, the immaterial gnosis, it is the Lord Paramaśiva Himself. I will teach you that, o Goddess. 
[.48]The Great Soul is truly immaterial—it is a light indeed, having no body. The body of the Lord is immaterial indeed, it does not have light as a body. It does not have a body, and it does not have organs. Without a body, without organs, [it is] the state of isolation itself, immaterial. The knower of reality, having known He who is called Śiva as being void [and] immaterial. The body of the Lord [in His] immaterial [aspect] should be known by the knower of reality. He abandons the liṅga, [which is also] immaterial [indeed]. Since He (i.e., the Lord) is immaterial Himself, he abandons the liṅga. And the immaterial in the form of a liṅga. That body of the Lord, when [it is] the material liṅga, its nature is the immaterial liṅga. When the liṅga is abandoned, Thereupon [he obtains] the Supreme Śiva instantly. In an instant he goes back again into the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.49]He▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya who performs all sorts of actions. He who knows about the immaterial gnosis does not discriminate about his actions. Bad and good. Bad and good [actions] are performed by him in that [condition]. He acts according to his wish, O Goddess. Whatever is according to his wish, it is done [by him]. He is truly a knower of the Supreme Reality. Such is the way of acting of he who knows about the Supreme Reality, through his understanding of the immaterial gnosis. 
[.50]The▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya exalted state of the knowledge of the praṇava. This holy gnosis of the praṇava, it is exalted. Its characteristic is that it is difficult to obtain in the Tantra[s]. Its accurate description is difficult to obtain in other scriptures. [And] in this [very] Tantra [too], o Goddess. This scripture of yours here, it is difficult, o Goddess. He acts according to his wish at all times. He who knows about the excellence of the holy gnosis of the praṇava, he is at all times ‘as he pleases’ with respect to his actions. 
[.51][This is] the completion of the Succinct Exposition of the Gnosis, characterized by [the speech] uttered by Śiva. The instructions of the Lord Śiva are the Succinct Exposition of the Gnosis. Further, as for the instability of the knowledge of the yogin about the correct sequence of the prescribed regimen, its causes have been taught by the Lord. 
 [.52] Thus [ends] the treatise entitled ‘The Succinct Exposition of the Gnosis’,newline Chapter 3.
    [.1]AllGoddess the [souls] whose forms is light, the pure immaterial gnosis, [and] the precepts have been enunciated: having known [them], one [will not obtain] transmigration. 
 [.2]The speech of the Lord to me before was as follows: according to your words, the yogin, if he knows about the immaterial gnosis—for it is the final delimitation of all the lights—surely he will not become an incarnated being again.
[.3]The maṇḍalas have been uttered to me, provided with all the deities; [they] have been enunciated before, among other [topics]. Transmigration will not be obtained [by him]. 
 [.4]Thus was the speech to me: according to the Lord, the adept, if he knows that all the deities are the body of the maṇḍala, surely he will not be born again.
[.5][Those who] constantly perform all mudrās and acts of worship, and the prescribed ritual actions [along with] gnosis reach the Supreme Śiva. 
 [.6]Another [speech of the Lord] was as follows: all the mudrās and acts of worship, and all the ritual actions, they have to be performed by the yogin daily. The Leader among Yogins, having performed those actions, reaches the station of the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.7]All the prescribed acts have likewise been proclaimed in the Śaiva Tantras [as leading to] reincarnation. All the mudrās have to be taught again in like manner, [i.e.] causing reincarnation, here in the Holy Siddhānta to me. Tell me, o God of gods: is this true, or is it false? With your permission, o Lord, who is wrong, and who is right? 
[.8]The state of the Supreme Lord is the knowledge. Has not [this been told to be] such by Yourself—Śiva? The principle of the Lord Paramaśiva embodies the knowledge. according to your words. Being difficult to obtain in the Śaiva Tantras. It is difficult to be obtained here in the holy scriptures of the Siddhānta-Gnosis.Once again, is it false [or] true? Is it false or true? That should be told to me again.\\ The speech of the Goddess being such, God spoke: 
[.9]‘TheLord [state of the] Supreme Śiva has been told to me before by Śiva. Indeed, Lord Paramaśiva spoke to me, when he said that mudrās and so on [lead to] reincarnation’. Thus were her (i.e., the Goddess’) words to me. All that, and that much indeed, has been taught, o fair-faced one. That is the reason why it has been taught to you. Such were your questions to me before. 
[.10]Yourself are, o Goddess, neither non-truth nor non-untruth: The goddess does not embody untruth and truth. Just like I do not embody untruth and truth, in the same way you do not embody untruth and truth. Gods, human beings, and animals [are] truth and untruth, o fair-faced one. However, Gods, the human beings and animals, they embody the untruth and the truth.%
[.11]Human beings perform ritual, asceticism, as well as the prescribed regimen according to the true religion at all times; all [of that] is [both] endowed with gnosis and without gnosis, o Goddess. 
 [.12]The ritual, asceticism, observances, prescribed conduct, the right order of the prescribed regimen are as follows: they are true, o Goddess. They should be known [as being] thus: intelligent, and also [as that which has] given up knowledge. All of them, they are constantly performed by the human beings. 
[.13]He whose mind is constantly addicted to those [observances and rituals], o Goddess. The person whose mind is addicted to the prescribed conduct. By means of those very [observances and rituals] the bond of action [arises]. Such person is ensnared by the action. Therefore, [he] not liberated. For the yogin, [who is] bewildered by me. The meaning is: this yogin is ignorant\ about Me if he performs the mudrās, etc. 
[.14]Having perpetually abandoned the prescribed regimen of worship [de\-scribed] in the Śaiva Tantras. Therefore, the task of the yogin is that he should abandon perpetually the prescribed regimen of mudrās and worship [de\-scribed] there in the Siddhānta scriptures. Having abandoned the aim. Further, he should abandon the aim. Thereafter, [he should act] like [when the scripture] of Paśupati [is abandoned]. Like when the reverend Paśupati is abandoned: in such a way your sacred scriptures should be abandoned here [and now]. 
[.15]All mudrās etc. are my forms, o fair-faced one. All of them, the mudrās etc., they are my forms, o Goddess. All my forms are the black etc., o six-faced one. In the same manner, o my son Kumāra, the ensemble of the [faces whose colours are] black etc., that is my body. 
[.16]He who has known the material, o Goddess. My teaching to you, that is the body of the god in material form. That is perceived by the yogin. That person moves to and fro in the cycle of transmigration. He obtains suffering, and the cycle of existence. O goddess, the brilliance whose essence is Śiva. Further, he who perceives the body of the Lord when he sees a light, he obtains suffering and the cycle of existence. 
[.17]Thus, my secret gnosis. In this circumstance, there is suffering; that is the reason why you should listen to my esoteric gnosis, o Goddess. Listen, just like you were a hearer before. Like when you heard my speeches formerly, in a similar manner listen to the immaterial gnosis. 
[.18]The yogin who desires the result of release; his own son, livestock, and relatives. Likewise is the yogin: he is one who desires release. If he has a son, as well as relatives and livestock, he should have them listen to the holy immaterial gnosis. 
[.19]The gnosis that is my secret doctrine, difficult to obtain, o goddess. This gnosis that has been made secret by me, o Goddess; it is extremely esoteric. It is truly difficult to obtain. The eternal gnosis, that should be known by the learned master who desires to obtain release. You should know [its] characteristics at all times. If your manner of knowing the supremely secret gnosis is constant, o Goddess. [One] enters the supreme good, the immaterial station at the end of the void. If the immaterial gnosis is known by the yogin, he enters the station of the Lord Śiva. Its nature is void. 
[.20][He] obtains [the power of reaching anywhere] at will, perpetually. How is a yogin who enters the station of the Lord like? The [power of reaching anywhere] at will is met by him, perpetually. Below, above, and horizontally. Such is what is called yathecchā: he sets foot below and above, [which] are crossed over by him. Because of [the power of] pervasion and of creating anything at will. Also, everything comes [to him] according to his wish. Because of [his] subtlety, [he is] the Supreme Śiva. In view of the fact that he is subtle, he is a Leader among Yogins. For he has already [attained] the state of unity with the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.21]One should abandon the material gnosis. The state of one who obtains the immaterial gnosis being such (i.e., one with Śiva), that is the reason why the practitioner should abandon the material gnosis. The immaterial [gnosis, leading to the] untainted [state, should be embraced]. Further, the practitioner should know only the immaterial gnosis, for [in the state of release caused by it,] the pleasure and pain have been completely left behind. 
[.22]Śiva eternally embodies wind. How is the body of the Lord [coinciding with the] immaterial gnosis? His body is the wind. It is eternal. The knower of the Supreme Reality knows. He should be known by the learned master. That immaterial, untainted [state]. Such were the words of the Lord to the Goddess. The Goddess spoke:
[.23]OGoddess\newline▷ novarnas Lord God of Gods, [bearer of] the bull-banner, Lord of the whole world, Lord of the Gods, tell me [about] the gnosis (jñāna) and the ignorance (vijñāna). 
 [.24]O Lord, foremost among all gods, my master, using the bull as a ve\-hi\-cle, king of the entire World-Egg—teach me about the gnosis and the ignorance!
[.25]Is worship the supreme good? And what about the superiority of mudrās? And what about the superiority of mantras? And what about the superiority of conglomerate(-mantras)? 
 [.26]I would like to ask another question, as follows: what is preferable among the superiority of worship and mudrās, as well as all the mantras and conglomerate-mantras? 
[.27]What is gnosis, and what is ignorance? Also, I would like to ask you the following, [i.e. about] the gnosis and the ignorance. [Which one] bestows heaven, and [which one] bestows liberation? Which one bestows heaven, and [which one] liberation? The greatness of the praṇava. What is the excellence of the holy praṇava, the reason why [it is] excellent? Tell me [that], and [also,] what is [its] characteristic? I do not know about that. Therefore, teach me! 
[.28]For, o Lord protector, I am one whose nature is that of being merely a female slave. Here is the reason why you should speak to me. That should be told to me by the Lord, my master. Speak to me here and now! What is the reality [of] this praṇava, tell me according to the truth. I do not know the reality of the holy praṇava. That is why the Lord should tell it to me. Thus the Goddess asked to the Lord. God spoke:
[.29]MudrāsLord are superior to worship. Mantras are the best in relation to mudrās. The conglomerate[-mantras] are the best among mantras. The praṇava is superior to the conglomerate[-mantras]. 
 [.30]O Goddess, before you have asked me about the worship. I will tell you about that. The mudrās are superior to worship. The mantras are superior to mudrās. The conglomerate-mantra is superior to all mantras, and the conglomerate-praṇava is superior to them.
[.31]Among all the conglomerate[-mantras], the praṇava is the greatest conglomerate[-mantra]. The resonance, the end of the resonance and the dot are known as the immaterial body. 
 [.32]All the conglomerate-mantras, they transform into the conglomerate-praṇava. They are endowed with the resonance, the end of the resonance, and the dot. When the praṇava is like that, that is my immaterial body. 
[.33]O Goddess, the praṇava is threefold: short, long, and protracted. The praṇava, o Goddess, has three forms: short, long, and protracted. Such is its body. It is called Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ, and Svar. That is designated as the Three Worlds. The praṇava is taught to be threefold. That is the body of the threefold praṇava. That should be remembered by the practitioner. 
[.34]O Great Goddess, the praṇava with one dot is short. The short praṇava, its dot is one. The praṇava with one dot is long. The praṇava whose dots are two, it is called long. The praṇava with three dots is protracted. The praṇava whose dots are three, it is called protracted. 
[.35][The praṇava] with one dot is creation. The praṇava whose dot is one, it is creation. [The praṇava] with two dots is maintenance. The praṇava whose dots are two, it is maintenance. [The praṇava] with three dots is dissolution. The praṇava whose dots are three, it is dissolution. The praṇava is taught as having three dots. The body of the praṇava should be remembered to be thus. 
[.36]Brahmā is to be regarded as the short. The short praṇava, it is Brahmā. And Viṣṇu as the long. The long praṇava, it is Viṣṇu. Īśvara is to be regarded as the protracted. The protracted praṇava, it is Īśvara. Those should be known by the practitioner. 
[.37]Know Brahmā to be the Nature. The revered Brahmā is the Unevolved Matter. Viṣṇu is the Spirit. The reverend Viṣṇu is the Spirit. Īśvara is the son. The reverend Īśvara is the son. The threefold [praṇava] bestows heaven and release. Such is the succession of the three praṇavas. 
[.38]O Great Goddess, Viṣṇu is creation. The reverend Viṣṇu replaces Unevolved Matter. Īśvara is the Spirit. The reverend Īśvara is the Spirit. Know Brahmā to be the son. The reverend Brahmā is the son. The threefold [praṇava] bestows heaven and release. Such is the succession of the three praṇavas. 
[.39]The Unevolved Matter is taught to be Īśvara. The reverend Īśvara is the Unevolved Matter. Brahmā is the Spirit. The reverend Brahmā is the Spirit. And Viṣṇu is the son. The reverend Viṣṇu is the son. This is the [reality of the praṇava,] characterised by three divisions. The reverend Īśvara is the Unevolved Matter. The reverend Brahmā is the Spirit. The reverend Viṣṇu is the son. The body of the three praṇavas is divided like that. 
[.40]The production of Brahmā is in the morning. The Lord Brahmā is in the morning. Viṣṇu is at midday. The reverend Viṣṇu is in the middle of the day. Maheśvara is in the evening. The reverend Īśvara is the evening. The threefold [praṇava] bestows heaven and release. The succession of the holy praṇava is as follows: Known the bhurloka to be Brahmā. The reverend Brahmā is the bhurloka. The Bhuvaḥ is taught to be Viṣṇu. The reverend Viṣṇu is the bhuvarloka. The svarloka is Maheśvara. The reverend Maheśvara is the svarloka. The praṇava is taught to be threefold. Such are the embodiments of the praṇava. 
[.41]Brahmā is at the bottom, o Goddess. The reverend Brahmā is at the bottom. Viṣṇu is in the middle. The reverend Viṣṇu is in the middle. Maheśvara is at the top. The reverend Īśvara is at the top. The praṇava is taught to be threefold. The body of the threefold praṇava should be known to be such. 
[.42]The bhurloka has one dot. The praṇava whose dot is one, it is the bhurloka. The bhuvarloka has two dots. The praṇava whose dots are two, it is the bhuvarloka. The svarloka has three dots. The praṇava whose dots are three, it is called svarloka. The praṇava is taught to be threefold. The body of the three praṇavas is divided like that. 
[.43]The three praṇavas, o my son Kumāra, [They are] material, not immaterial. They are material; they are not immaterial. The [praṇava having] one, two, or three of the dots. Their types are as follows: The praṇava whose dot is one, my body of such type is material. If its dots are two, that is my material-cum-immaterial body. But the [praṇava] having three dots is immaterial. But the praṇava whose dots are three, that is my immaterial body, if it is such. You should know [this], o Goddess. 
[.44]Know six dots as immaterial. It is such, o my son Kumāra, that you know the praṇava whose dots are six, for that is my immaterial body. [The praṇava having] one [dot] is Brahmā, o six-faced one. As for the praṇava whose dot is single, its embodiment is Brahmā. Viṣṇu has two, Maheśvara has three. The one having two dots, its embodiment is Viṣṇu. The praṇava that has three dots, its embodiment is Maheśvara. The [praṇava] having six dots is to be known as immaterial. That is the reason why the praṇava whose dots are six has to be known by you, o my son Kumāra: it is designated as the immaterial embodiment of the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.45]The three and the three are the six dots. How do they look like? As follows: The praṇava whose dots are three, that is the embodiment of the Lord Paramaśiva. Brāhmā, Viṣṇu, Mahādeva, as well as the resonance and the end of the resonance. Furthermore, the resonance and the end of the resonance, along with the dot, their embodiment is the Tripuruṣa. The subtle triad is the Power of Knowledge. The Īśvara-dot (īśvaravindu), that is called Power of Knowledge.
[.46]Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara are the dot, the resonance, and the end of the resonance. Called ‘Rudra-Kāla-Śiva’, they are both material and immaterial. 
 [.47]The dot, the resonance, and the end of the resonance, the reverend Tripuruṣa takes on a body in them. They are designated as ‘Rudra-Kāla-Śiva’. They are both material and immaterial. 
[.48]The Power of Action, Pervasion and Knowledge are dissolved. The Power of Action, the Power of Knowledge, and the Power of Pervasion, all of them are dissolved. The material is dissolved into the immaterial. The material dissolves into the immaterial. Know, o fair-faced one. You should know, my son, reverend Kumāra. 
[.49]Paramaśiva is above. The Lord Paramaśiva is above. Sadāśiva is in the middle. The reverend Sadāśiva is in the middle. Sadārudra is below. The reverend Sadārudra is below. The cause of the Three Constituents [of Nature] is threefold. Such are the three that are the causes of the Three Constituents. 
[.50]Having known thus, the knower of reality, o Goddess. When the knower of reality knows them. Becomes the Supreme Śiva. He returns to the Lord Paramaśiva. The five Brahma-syllables compressed together. As for the compressing together of the syllables of the five Brahma[mantras]: Short, long, and protracted, they assume a short, long, and protracted form. 
[.51]Creation, maintenance, and dissolution. The short, long, and protracted, they assume the form of creation, maintenance, and dissolution. This universe is the Brahma-syllables. The five Brahma-syllables are compressed. They transform into the syllable oṁ. In brief, the praṇava is taught to be threefold, o Goddess. The concise explanation of the praṇava is that its embodiments are three. 
[.52]Sadārudra is the long. The reverend Sadārudra is the long. †...† The reverend Sadāśiva is the protracted. He who truly knows. He who knows about the reality. Becomes the Supreme Śiva. He returns to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.53]The resonance is the egg (aṇḍa)\ of the Supreme Śiva, and Īśāna indeed. The reverend Paramaśiva resides in the resonance. His embodiment is Īśāna. The seed of Sadāśiva is the dot, [which is] Tatpuruṣa. The reverend Sadāsiva resides in the dot. His embodiment is Tatpuruṣa. 
[.54]The seed of Sadārudra is the moon, and Aghora indeed. The reverend Sadārudra resides in the half-moon. His embodiment is Aghora. O Goddess, Vāma and Sadyas (i.e., Sadyojāta) are known as female and male at the same time. Vāmadeva and Sadya, their embodiment is Unevolved Matter-cum-Spirit. It should be known by the practitioner. 
[.55]The resonance is born from the immaterial. The resonance is born from the immaterial. The dot is produced from the resonance. The dot is born from the resonance. The production of the moon is from the dot. The half-moon is born from the dot. The viśva (i.e., oṁ) is produced from the moon. The viśva is born from the moon. Such is how the production of the holy praṇava looks like.
[.56]The viśva dissolves into the moon. The moon dissolves into the dot. The dot dissolves in the resonance. The resonance is dissolved into the immaterial. 
 [.57]The holy viśva dissolves into the half-moon. The half-moon dissolves into the dot. The dot dissolves in the resonance. The resonance dissolves into the immaterial. Such is how the dissolution looks like. 
[.58]He is to be known as being material indeed. The God in [His] material aspect, He is threefold. Śiva is said to be immaterial. The reverend Paramaśiva is immaterial. The praṇava having six dots is to be known as the Supreme Śiva, immaterial. The six dots should be known as the embodiment of the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.59]He who has known the supreme dot. That is the reason why the task of the wise one is to know these six dots. If he knows, that is the reason why he goes back to the Lord \arrowrightx Paramaśiva. This secret, o Great Goddess. Such a gnosis should be kept secret by the learned master. The learned master does not reveal it. His behaviour is to keep it secret. He should not reveal it to others. If anyone reveals it because of ignorance. If there is an ignorant man who bestows the holy gnosis. He reaches hell. He reaches the hell.
[.60]The five Brahma-syllables compressed together; [the] short, long and protracted [aspects of the pranava]; and production, maintenance, and dissolution have been treated by Īśāna. 
 [.61] The agglomeration of the Pañcabrahma-syllables assumes the form of short, long, and protracted, as well as production, maintenance, and dissolution. [Such] were the words of the Lord to the Goddess. 
 [.62] Thus [ends] the scripture entitled ‘The Storehouse of Worlds’, Chapter 9. 
    [.1]Such were the words of the Lord. The Goddess spoke: 
[.2]O Lord,Goddess by which means the goal of union with happiness. Thus is my question to you, o Lord: what is the means of the learned master, through which the nature of spiritual bliss will be obtained? [And] neither old age nor disease nor suffering is met with, because of youthfulness? And one will not meet with suffering, old age and disease, along with [maintaining] a youthful aspect. 
[.3]All [beings] abandon life. Furthermore, when his death strikes, then, [how should one act] for the sake of happiness, o Almighty? What is the behaviour of the practitioner, by which he will not cause the sudden striking of death, and [will be] happy when he will die, without using suffering as a means? And what is the station of the Supreme Lord, the happiness that is the destruction of suffering? And what should be his behaviour in order to obtain the station of the Lord Śiva, the state that is left behind by pleasure and pain?\\ {\curlybl}Īśvara should be placed in the east.{\curlybr} Such were the words of the Goddess. God spoke: 
[.4]TheLord; ▷ 10.3-7 course of action of the learned master, when death comes, is as follows, o Goddess: +Īśvara should be placed in the east.+ The Lord Īśvara, his abode is the East. Brahmā abides in the South. The Lord Brahmā is in the South. Mahādeva is in the West. The reverend Mahādeva is in the West. Viṣṇu is in the North. The reverend Viṣṇu is in the North. In the centre is the Supreme Śiva. The Lord Paramaśiva is in the centre. He, the knower of yoga, [knows] thus, o Goddess. Such is the course of action of he who knows the yoga, o Goddess. The vital breath, having been raised through yoga. Once he has known the gods of the directions and the centre, he pulls out his vital breath. Yoga is his means to pull it out. Goes upwards, o Pārvatī. His course of action to pull out its vital breath is to move it upwards.% 
[.5]He, the knower of yoga, is one whose vital breath has been cut with the knife that is the knowledge of the praṇava. The course of action of he who knows the secret means (yogasandhi) is as follows: the knowledge of the praṇava, it serves as a creese by means of which he will cut his vital principle. The palate is pressed together with the tip of the tongue. The point of the tip of the tongue should cover the gullet. The eyes are closely connected with the palate. And the gaze should be directed towards the gullet. 
[.6]Having pierced the skull with the breath. When the action of the practitioner is thus, [i.e.] his skull is split by the breath, if so, which is the way of the holy Soul? It is released from the Door of Śiva. It uses as a way the Door of Śiva. The vital breath goes away through that door, and the praṇava is released. It uses as a way yonder. The syllable oṁ should be abandoned by him. The dot is the companion of the holy Life Principle as it leaves behind the Door. 
[.7]The yogin who abandons the vital breath. When the vital breath is left behind, Is absorbed into the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. What is His nature? Omnipervasive and omnipresent. \arrowrightx He equally occupies the entire universe, in view of the fact that he is one with the Lord Paramaśiva. On account of [his] subtleness, he is the Supreme Śiva. Because of being present as the essence of the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.8]I will tell you, o Great Goddess, [how] release itself is obtained. As there is something about which you previously asked me, o Goddess, I will teach you about that. It is the cause of the obtainment of release. The coming of death does not grant release. When one does not know the coming of death, that is not release. Listen, together with the six-faced one! You should listen to my teaching to you, o Goddess, along with Kumāra.
[.9]O▷ 10.8-9 Goddess, in a field, a forest, the bank of a river, a cave, a mountain, the root of a tree, a slab of rock, the knower of yoga gives up the vital breath. 
 [.10]Where will the death of the knower of the secret means occur? [Such is] your question, o Goddess. Here it is: in a rice field, in a forest, the bank of a river, in a cave, on a mountain, in the root of a tree there [on that mountain], and on a slab of rock. There he will give up his life.
[.11]The▷ 10.8-9 knower of yoga gives up the vital breath in a penance-grove, a forest, a house, a deserted mountain, a cave, an open ground, or an island. 
 [.12]Other [places where] his death will occur are the following: in a penance-grove, in a forest, in a house, in a cave, in a mountain, on an island, or in an open field—it is there that he gives up his life. If he dies there, he goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.13]In whichever of those places the wise one dies. Then, if he dies there, the course of action of the learned master is to know when he will die. He is absorbed into the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. \arrowrightx There is no doubt about the Siddhānta. Do not be doubtful with regard to the holy scripture of the Siddhānta. A scripture [that is] extremely difficult to grasp. For this holy scripture is extremely difficult. 
[.14]If the wise one dies in a field. What is the form of the reverend Death that is seen by the sage if he dies in a rice field? His own Death (i.e., M{\rdit}tyu) has the face of a plough. A plough is the face of the reverend Death. It is seen in the form of a light. And it has the form of a light when it is seen. When the form of the reverend Death is seen by him, He is absorbed into the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.15]If the sage dies on a mountain. If the yogin dies on a mountain. His own Death has the form of an elephant. If so, the form of the reverend Death is an elephant. It is seen in the form of a light. It has the form of a light [when] seen. He is absorbed into the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.16][If] the sage dies in the foot of a tree. If the learned master dies in the foot of a tree. His own Death has the form of a Nāga. If so, the form of the reverend Death is a Nāga. It is seen in the form of a light. It has the form of a light [when] seen. He is absorbed into the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.17][If] the sage dies on a mountain peak. If the learned master dies on the top of a mountain. It is seen in a white aspect. If so, the colour of the reverend Death is white. His own Death has the form of a light. And it has the form of a light when it is seen. He is absorbed into the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.18][If] the sage dies in a penance grove. If the yogin dies in a hermitage in the forest. His own Time [of death, personified as Kāla] has the aspect of an ascetic. If so, the aspect of the reverend Time is like that of an ascetic. It is seen in the form of a light. And it has the form of a light when it is seen. When the form of the reverend one is seen by him, He is absorbed into the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.19][If] the sage dies in a town. If the yogin dies in a town. His own Time has the aspect of a bull. If so, the reverend Time has the aspect of a bull. It is seen in the form of a light. And it has the form of a light when it is seen. He is absorbed into the Supreme Śiva. When the form of the reverend Death is seen by the yogin, he reaches the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.20]This gnosis is Sadārudra. Like when the yogin knows about the gnosis of the reverend Sadārudra. He reaches the station of Sadāśiva. If so, he goes back to the stage of the Lord Sadāśiva. This gnosis is Sadāśiva. If the Lord Sadāśiva serves as his gnosis. He reaches the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.21]Having known his own Time in this manner. Thus is the appearance of the body of the reverend Time. % The yogin should know it. When he has known it, He is absorbed into Me, like fire. He [becomes] one [with] Me, like fire, as he is released from sin. Having known his own Time in this manner. When he knows the body of Time [as] Sadāśiva, He enters my body, [becoming] one and the same. I [become] one with you. 
[.22]Having→ p. novarnas known the secret in this manner. This gnosis of mine, o Goddess, should be known by the yogin. He should not think about anything at all. His course of action when he knows that is to not be weak because of thinking. All of those who may know My gnosis, Whether a woman, a man or an eunuch, or even a barbarian, o Maheśvarī. O Maheśvarī, o Goddess, one who knows My gnosis [belongs to] any kind of [people], whether a woman, an eunuch or a man, or even a person of low birth indeed. \arrowrightx There is no doubt about the Siddhānta. It should not be doubted. That is why you should not doubt about your sacred scripture, o my son reverend Kumāra. What is called ‘Tantra’ is difficult indeed. For this sacred scripture of the Siddhānta is difficult. \indentTheKumāra true doctrine has been learned by me. The holy scripture, o Goddess, has been taught to me by the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.23]There is no doubt about the Siddhānta. Likewise, o Goddess, do not be doubtful about your sacred scripture of the Siddhānta. Regarding that, it is extremely difficult. For this doctrine is difficult. I have been instructed by the Supreme Śiva Himself, o Pārvatī. For this esoteric scripture has been taught to me by the Lord Paramaśiva Himself, o Goddess. 
[.24]ThereLord is no doubt toward the light. Further, what the yogin should do is not to have any doubts concerning the non-existence of the light that is seen by him. He reaches that Supreme Śiva. For his goal will be in the Lord Paramaśiva. [There is] a light, and yet that light does not [ exist]. His light exists and does not exist, He enters the Supreme Śiva. If so, he goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva by way of the scripture on the Siddhānta-Gnosis. 
[.25]If the light inside the pupils disappears, the sage dies. If so, i.e. if the light in the pupils of the eye disappears, the yogin dies. And [if] the great light in the eye is like fire, the sage is not liable to death. It so happens that the light is like fire: certainly, if it is so, the yogin does not die. 
[.26]This aforementioned pupil [without glow being] in the eyes, the praṇava [should be uttered] immediately. If there is no glow in the pupils of his eyes, his recitation of the holy praṇava should not have any interval [of time]. The vital breath goes out through that door, unseen by those who can be seen, o fair-faced one. When the vital breath disappears, the Door of Śiva is left behind by it. It sees, being not seen. It is united with the Lord. What is the course of action of the yogin? He enters the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the station of the Lord Paramaśiva. Pervasive, omnipresent, supreme. If so, he is supreme; he fills the whole universe. 
[.27]The learned one dies in a cave or in a house. If the yogin dies in a house, or in a cave, His own Time has the aspect of a man. The aspect of the reverend Death is a man. He is seen in the form of a light. And the reverend Death is seen by him in the form of a light. He enters the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.28]The learned one dies in an arid land. If the yogin dies in a non-irrigated open field, His own Time has the appearance of empty space. If so, the reverend Time has the appearance of space. He is seen in the form of a light. And, if so, he is seen in the form of a light. He enters the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord. 
[.29]The learned one dies in a hermitage. If the yogin dies in a lonely penance-grove. His own Death has the aspect of a liṅga. If so, the aspect of the reverend Death is like that of a liṅga. He is seen in the form of a light. When he is seen by the yogin, He enters the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.30]The sage dies on a battleground: His own Death has the aspect of Rudra. If the yogin dies on the battlefield, the reverend Death has the aspect of Rudra; if so, he is fear-inspiring. If he is seen in the form of a light. And he has the form of a light. If he (Death) is seen as such, He enters the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the abode of the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.31]If the sage is in the home of an outcaste when his last hour strikes, o fair-faced one. If the yogin dies in the home of an outcaste, His own Death would have the aspect of Krodha. If so, the reverend Death has the aspect of Krodha. If he is seen in the form of a light. And he has the form of a light when he is seen. If his appearance is like this, He enters the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the Lord Paramaśiva. 
[.32]Look, my son Kumāra. [If] the sage [undergoes] this [type of death] in the fourteenth [day of the lunar fortnight, Death] has the aspect of the Ten Rudras. Thus, the reverend Rudra has fourteen aspects. Having perceived his own Time. That is what the yogin will perceive, when his death strikes. When he perceives that, He enters the Supreme Śiva. He goes back to the station of the Lord Paramaśiva. Such were the words of the Lord. The Goddess replied: 
[.33]WhyGoddess is this form of Sadārudra called Kāla indeed? What is the reason why the Lord has taught the reverend Sadārudra to embody the reverend Kāla? What is his form in such circumstance, according to the Lord? What are his manifestations?\ Thus were the words of the Goddess. The God spoke. The Lord replied: 
[.34]This KālaLord is Sadārudra. This reverend Kāla, here is the reason why he embodies the Lord Sadārudra. If the yogin knows that the reverend Kāla embodies Sadārudra, He reaches this Sadāśiva, he goes back to the station of the Lord Sadāśiva. Having reached this Sadāśiva. The explanation is: the embodiment of this reverend Sadāśiva is the reverend Kāla. 
[.35]And similarly, his abode are the pupils of the eyes. If his (i.e., the yogin’s) face is pale, or if the sight of their respective [directions] is mixed together, or if they are not full, or again if the distinction of [the pupils from the white of] his eyes is not clearly visible, if so, surely death will strike. 
[.36]The learned one knows thus. The yogin should know thus. The ascetic makes an assertion. This manner of recognizing should be done by the practitioner: ‘O Soul, go to the Supreme!’ If so, the holy Soul will clearly depart towards the Supreme Station. Here is another [announcement]: ‘The emptiness of the bodies is attained!’ Certainly [he] crosses over into the emptiness of the body if his manner of recognising is thus. This is dying whose origin is not suffering. 
[.37]The everlasting Self is seen [as] a light on mirrors. What is the yogin’s manner of seeing his own Self? He should be like a mirror at all time. Having perceived thus, o Goddess. Such is the yogin’s manner of seeing his own Self. When it is seen by him, He abandons the vital breath in that instant. His life should be abandoned in the time[span] of an instant. 
[.38]He enters Me, o Goddess. When the yogin dies in such a way, [his] direction is not mistaken as he goes to Me. He is like the ocean in relation to the rivers. Here is his simile, among others: like the water of the rivers as it meets the ocean, the yogin and Myself are likewise. Here is another [simile]: The rain is first in the cloud, then reaches the ocean. \arrowrightx Like a cloud filled with water: in the beginning, the rain falls on the sea. The salty[ness] is met with by it. In the same manner is the yogin with respect to my body, o Goddess. 
[.39]Likewise his own body is endowed with Śiva and the Power. How is the nature of the body of the yogin in the beginning? It is different from my body, in the beginning. Thus is his nature. When it possesses the Power of the Lord, By virtue of the absorption of a river in the ocean, [it is] like the action of the water of the rivers meeting with the sea. Thereafter, he reaches Me, in a state of unity. In the end, his body is one: thus is the yogin with Me. 
[.40]O Goddess, [he who] knows the scripture. Thus is the nature of the scripture, which you should know, o Goddess. Characterized by union with happiness. Its characteristic quality is the obtainment of happiness. Even though it has been made secret by God. That speech that has been made secret by the Lord, I shall reveal it to you fully. It is being told right now to you, along with its scripture.
 [.41]Thus [ends] Chapter 10, the Scripture on the Siddhānta, the Secret Gnosis. 
    [.1]Thus were the words of the Lord to the Goddess. The Goddess spoke: 
[.2]I listenGoddess to your speech [about] the material and immaterial gnosis. Your speech is heard by me, [about] the material and immaterial gnosis. Happiness delivered to the practitioner. The goal of your words is the happiness of the practitioner. Here and in the other world. Here and now, as well as in the future. 
[.3]One obtains happiness [by means of] the material. He obtains happiness here and now. One will obtain release [by means of] the immaterial. By means of the immaterial, release is obtained by him. I am going to ask you about the material. The material, that will be asked by me to you, o Lord. In this body. Tell me [about it]! You should tell me about it. 
[.4]What was previously called immaterial, without attributes, is the means to attain release. And the immaterial that has been taught by the Lord previously, which you have said to be without attributes, it is a means of release. a u ma—what are called the three syllables—are separated, o Lord. And the three syllables, whose embodiments are a u ma, are separated by the Lord.
[.5]The syllable a is separated. The syllable u is separated. The syllable ma is separated. What is [their] function? 
 [.6]The a, u, and ma, they make the Lord become one in the 3; their activities are one. With your permission, o Lord, this being so, [will there be] success? 
[.7]The activity of the syllable a is production. For the task of the syllable a is production. The syllable u is maintenance. The syllable u is maintenance. The syllable ma is dissolution. The syllable ma embodies dissolution. A single nature becomes threefold. If the three [become] one, what is the reason of the oneness? For their activities are different.
[.8] The practitioner who is seeking to accomplish happiness here in this world doubts about the gnosis, having uttered those names [of God called the Five] Brahma[mantra]s. 
 [.9]Something [else] that [You] should teach me is as follows: the means of the practitioner who desires to obtain happiness in his life—for it is not evident that they are difficult to obtain. That should be taught to me by the Lord. Thus were the words of the Goddess to the Lord. The Lord spoke, His words were: 
[.10]TheLord three syllables are all the [three] chiefs of the gods. What I have called the three syllables, o Goddess, are the embodiment of the ensemble of the Gods. One’s own happiness, characterized by auspiciousness. And also one’s own happiness, auspicious. What are named Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ and Svar, that is called the embodiment of the Three Worlds. They consider a, u and ma as the means. The three syllables, according to my words, their embodiments are a, u, and ma. Those are the means of the practitioner to obtain the happiness, if he knows them, o Goddess. 
[.11]The a is the abode of Brahmā. Here is the evidence that they embody the Gods: the syllable a is the body of Brahmā. The u is Viṣṇu. The u is the body of Viṣṇu. One should know the syllable ma to be Īśvara. The ma is the body of Īśvara. They are called the Three Syllables. Such are the embodiments of the Three Syllables taught by me to you, o Goddess. What are their emplacements? As follows: 
[.12]The a is the embodiment [of the Lord] in the south. The a is the southern embodiment. The u is the northern embodiment. The syllable u is the northern image. The ma is the middle image. The ma is the image in the middle. They are called the Three Syllables. Such is the arrangement of the Three Syllables that has been taught by me to you, o Goddess. Their positioning in the body is as follows: 
[.13]The a is the private parts. The private parts are the syllable a. The u is the navel. The u is the navel. One should know the ma as the heart. The ma is the heart. Such is the enumeration of their emplacements, one of several. They are called the Three Syllables. Such are the forms of the Three Syllables, o Goddess. 
[.14]The a is said to be the face. The a is the face. The u is the left nostril. The u is the left nostril. The ma is in the right nostril. The ma is the nostril on the right. They are called the Three Syllables. Such are the forms of the Three Syllables, o Goddess. 
[.15]The a is the tip of the nose. The syllable a is the tip of the nose. The u is in the left eye. The u is the eye of the Lord on the left. The ma is the eye on the right. The ma is the eye of the Lord on the right. They are called the Three Syllables. Such are the forms of the Three Syllables. 
[.16]The a is the ear on the right. The a is the ear of the Lord that is on the right. The u is the ear on the left. The u is the ear of the Lord that is on the left. The ma is known [to be] in the head. The ma is the head of the Lord. They are called the Three Syllables. Such are the forms of the Three Syllables. 
[.17]The a is the utterance at the beginning. The a is the origin of the utterance. The u is the middle of the utterance. The u is the middle of the utterance. The ma is the end of the utterance. The ma is the end of the utterance. That which is one in essence becomes discrete. Thus are the embodiments of the one and the differentiated. 
[.18]The u dissolves into the a. The u dissolves into the a. The a is dissolved into the ma. The a dissolves into the ma. The ma is dissolved into the moon. The ma dissolves into the half moon. The moon dissolves into the dot. The half moon dissolves into the dot. The dot dissolves into the resonance. The dot dissolves into the resonance. 
[.19]The dot originates from the resonance. The dot arises from the resonance. The origin of the moon is from the dot. The half moon arises from the dot. From that is the origination of the universe. The universe arises from the half moon. Existence and dissolution [alternate each other] again and again. Thus are the production, existence, and dissolution coming into being again and again. 
[.20]The Viśva (oṁ) originates from universe. What may be said of the syllable oṁ} is that it is the body of the whole universe. The Viśva dissolves in the moon. In the end, the syllable oṁ} is dissolved into the half moon. The moon dissolves into the dot. The half moon dissolves into the dot. The dot dissolves into the resonance. The dot dissolves into the resonance. The resonance is dissolved into the immaterial. The resonance dissolves into the immaterial. 
[.21]Thus▷ 11.18-20 is the reality of the praṇava. Thus is the reality of the praṇava. The dissolution and complete dissolution, o fair-faced one. This dissolution and complete dissolution, o Goddess. In the subtle centre in the tip of the nose. It is related that it resides in the tip of the nose. Here it is said that the two dots [reside]. Thus is the embodiment of the two dots that have been taught by me to you, o Goddess. 
[.22]The▷ 11.18-20 dot resides in the tip of the nose. The dot resides in the tip of the nose. It is proclaimed to be the Supreme Brahman. It is designated as the Supreme Brahman. Having known it, the knower of reality, o Goddess. It should be known by the knower of reality. Reaches happiness, eternally. If he knows it, he reaches lasting spiritual happiness. 
[.23]The▷ 11.18-20 two dots [are] in the tip of the nose. The two dots reside in the tip of the nose. [Their] union is the cause of liberation. Their meeting is the cause of liberation. 
[.24]He who knows truly. The course of action of he who knows about its reality [is:] Desiring happiness, he shall obtain happiness. Happiness being his desire, happiness is obtained by him. The means are manifold, o Goddess. The number of means is thus, o Goddess. Listen [about] the[ir] realities, o six-faced one. O Kumāra, my son, likewise you should listen to this doctrine. 
[.25]By employing the three fingers. The three fingers, they are constant[ly employed during practice]. Man obtains happiness. If so, the happiness is certainly obtained by means of them. With the thumb, middle finger, and index finger. Thumb, middle finger, and index finger: they are equally extraordinary. The openings of the nostrils having been obstructed. %nāsikārandhra\-rud\-dha\-yoḥ Both nostrils should be covered. As well as the tip of the nose, the eyes. The tip of the nose, the eyes. The ears [and] the head by the practitioners. The ears and the head by the practitioners. 
[.26]The expiation for the time of anger. What is the time in which he should apply [the fingers]? At the time of anger. Having been chosen by the great-souled one. What is the way that he should apply? Its way is the great one. In the left nostril, forcefully, he is endowed with the fiery gnosis. The divine quality of the left nostril as it is obstructed is to be the way through which anger is destroyed.
[.27]The locus of the bile destroys poison. The locus of the heart [gives] happiness. The locus of the Sense-Mind [gives] anger and what is characterised by happiness. 
 [.28]In short, the bodily wind in the bile destroys poison. The bodily wind in the heart, its function is [to produce] pleasure and pain. The bodily wind in the Sense-Mind, [its function is to produce] anger.
[.29]The▷ 11.18-20 learned one [should place] the supreme Two Dots on the tip of the nose [to realize] Sadāśiva. Very subtle among all beings, it is a supremely spotless locus. 
 [.30]The holy pair of dots are on the tip of the nose. The reverend Sadāśiva is very subtle. Further, it should be known that his body is immaterial.
[.31]Having▷ 11.18-20 gone out from the enclosure of the heart, Sadāśiva exists as the two dots; He arises in the tip of the nose, and is turned into breath. 
 [.32]The abode of the holy pair of dots is the heart. Coming out from the tip of the nose, they are turned into breath. They are the Lord Sadāśiva.
[.33][Sadāśiva-breath as] the two dots is pleasure and pain, and also furnished with qualities and devoid of qualities. Because he knows thus, he obtains happiness, both in this world and in the other world. 
 [.34]It is pleasure and pain; the nature of the the holy breath is to be furnished with qualities and devoid of qualities. It should be known by the practitioner: the material and the immaterial are obtained by way of it.
[.35]The ascetic pervades the Seven Worlds as the two dots, o Goddess, and [becomes] the Lord of the Seven Worlds and the Underworlds, [and pervades] this entire universe indeed. and the this entire universe indeed, without remainder. 
 [.36]What is the manifestation of the material happiness? As follows: The Seven Worlds are happy. The Seven Underworlds are happy because of him. The happiness is met with by him.
[.37]Whether▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya a forest-dweller, a town-born, or a pupil, o fair-faced one, the ascetic obtains a male and female slave and a house, or the condition of perfection. 
 [.38]As follows is another [outcome]: happiness is obtained by the ascetic, any objects of the senses [like] garments etc., whether he lives in a forest or in a town. A pupil is met by him, as well as a male slave and a female slave, and a house. And further, the state of supernatural prowess is met by him.
[.39]Whether▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya a woman or a man, [in the condition of] union or separation, the afflicted sinner is released from the fetter; the ascetic is released. 
 [.40]Thus is the manifestation of the happiness pertaining to the world of the senses being brought to an end by the practice.
[.41]This gnosis, o Great Goddess, is Sadāśiva turned into breath. He who does not know about [this] reality is deluded by my magical power. 
 [.42]If there is a learned master who doesn’t know about the essence of the practice of the gnosis, he is deluded by [my power of] beguilement.
[.43]The▷ 11.18-20 limit [of] Sadāśiva, o Great Goddess, is in the tip of the nose. Turned into breath, well-densified, it is characterized by both pleasure and pain. 
 [.44]The tip of the nose is the limit of the holy two dots. They are turned into breath. Their mode of existence is that they constantly exist in both the material and immaterial [reality].
[.45]The knower of reality, o Great Goddess, should not reveal such gnosis. [If] he reveals it out of stupidity, he reaches hell. 
 [.46]The holy material-and-immaterial is a doctrine about dissolution. It is not made light by the learned master.
[.47]O knower of reality, do not give the Śaivasiddhānta-Gnosis to him! It should not be given to the one who is not obedient. The teacher is revered through the acquisition [of wealth]. 
 [.48]The one belonging to the Śaivasiddhānta should not teach his scripture to the ignorant ones, and to the men without obedience for the teacher.
[.49]Give the Siddhānta-Gnosis to the chosen disciple, devoted, who has constantly turned himself into a servant [of the master], against [payment of] one-fifth paṇas of [his] wealth. 
 [.50]If the pupil is obedient, constantly devoted, in that [case] the holy Śai\-va\-sid\-dhān\-ta-gnosis should be taught by the learned master.
[.51]Not stealing, speaking the truth, devoted towards God, constantly studying: the clever one knows this Siddhānta-Gnosis, o Goddess. 
 [.52]The way of acting of the clever one—the likeness of the one who can be given [the holy gnosis is as follows]: a man who does not steal, a man who speaks the truth, a man who is devoted to God, a man who does not mock the scriptures.
[.53]At no time [the gnosis] should be given to the son who is ignorant, to the pupil who lacks wealth, [or to one] who constantly reproaches the teacher. 
 [.54]How does one who should not be given the holy Śaivasiddhānta-Gnosis look like? The man who mock him, and who is also critical toward the teacher.
[.55]One who is said to steal from others, a liar, one who is not a guardian of the gods. 
 [.56]The men who should not be given the scriptures are: a man who steals, a man who speaks untruthfully, a man who is not devoted to the gods, a man who mocks the holy scriptures.
[.57]One who is impure, one who does not follow the observances and religious austerities, one who is ill-behaved, and contrary to nature. 
 [.58]A man who is addicted to eating everything that is impure, a man who does not desire [to perform] religious austerities, a man who dislikes observances, a man who is vicious, a man who dislikes the proper behaviour. The appearance of one laughing at the holy scriptures of the Śaivasiddhānta is as follows—his ignorance is paramount:
[.59]The artifice [of such a non-believer] is [to ask] a question first, with the intent of contention; desirous of asking, [he makes] a speech, [where\-in] the Tantra of God is reviled. 
 [.60]Further, the artifice of one who dislikes the doctrine is to ask before, [then] to utter a speech for the second time, and finally to utter a dispute, as the Tantras of God were criticized out of his lack of any recollection at all. In short, he who mocks the holy scriptures of the Siddhānta, is condescending toward he who is practised in the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis.
 [.61][If] his manner [of acting] is impure, give the secret doctrine to another one. 
 [.62]For if the man who has already held fast to the holy Śaivasiddhānta is unsettled by another, and the words of an opponent criticising the holy scripture are followed by him, that is called impurity derived from another. Therefore, one devoted to the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis is exclusively a pupil whose conduct is proper.
[.63]Not to mention one who carries white [clothes but] is devoid of the knowledge of the master. 
 [.64]Here is another example of that [improper disciple]: there is a man who is ordered to wear white garments by the teacher. How could it be appropriate that the instructions of his own guru were put aside? Certainly, the knowledge of the teacher is a special blessing. Its standard is as follows: every instructions given by the guru should be obeyed, [with] diligence toward the holy Siddhānta, if the Siddhānta-Gnosis was adhered to formerly.
[.65]If one knows my secret [doctrine] called Śaivasiddhānta, which is difficult to obtain, he is not born again: he reaches the Supreme Śiva. 
 [.66]The condensed [exposition] of the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis is a supreme secret. The practitioner who knows it is released.
[.67]This gnosis is that entire universe. One should meditate on my secret. Guard it, o Supreme Goddess, as the ordainer within all beings. 
 [.68]The holy Siddhānta is a supreme secret. It should be guarded carefully by the Goddess. The world should be internalized.
[.69]This gnosis, o Great Goddess, is called Siddhānta by name. One should constantly meditate on it in secret. [Thereupon] the universe is claimed as one’s own on the earth. 
 [.70]Who is the companion of the Goddess in guarding the holy Siddhānta? Her means to amuse [herself] in the threefold world is the Lord:
[.71]I am the Spirit, o Great Goddess, [residing] inside the world as my Siddhānta. [My] wife is the reverend Great Goddess. [She] is called Nature, o knower of reality. 
 [.72]The reverend Spirit is the husband. The reverend Nature is the wife. The Siddhānta, called release, is the animate and inanimate living beings. You will wander about, having entered into the threefold world, o reverend Kumāra.
[.73]Having known thus, o Great Goddess, the material as well as the immaterial. 
 [.74]Thus are the essentials of the holy Siddhānta. The material and immaterial is known by the learned master. 
[.75]Having▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya eaten what is not to be eaten, and having performed both good and bad actions. The learned master expert in the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis is wholly unconstrained. Having drunk at all times what should not be drunk, he is free from all sins. He is wholly unconstrained, drinking what should not be drunk.
[.76]The▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya clever one performs good and bad actions. He reaches liberation by way of that [behaviour], free from all sins. 
 [.77]In short, the clever one obtains the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis, for he is not affected by those who are ignorant. The wise one is superior to them. Easily the actions will become clear by way of his knowing the past, present, and future. He has no hesitation towards good and bad actions.
[.78]The addiction to the mind is suppressed: [one should resort to] the gnostic scriptures at all times for the sake of the suppression of all sins, [as well as] the annihilation of all faults. 
 [.79]Therefore, the learned master has no hesitation when he practices the holy Sid\-dhān\-ta-gno\-sis, for he is able to destroy sinful deeds.
[.80]The▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya divisions of classes into four, with the Brahmans as the firsts, o Goddess, [is likewise dissolved]. One’s own power is the Śaivasiddhānta, the whole universe having turned into it. 
 [.81]Therefore, he is able to annihilate the sinful deeds, for all the social classes are annihilated by him.
[.82]Brahman,▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya warrior, worker, and servant: likewise these forms are hesitations, one by one. 
 [.83]\sqbrl To regard oneself as] a Brahman, a warrior, a worker, [or] a servant is a false notion. The hesitation and doubt of those [who do so] are great. They are subject to rebirth.
[.84]The▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya forms of all social classes are subject to rebirth, one by one. 
 [.85]Then the Brahmans, warriors, workers, and servants, they are the so-called four social classes. They are subject to rebirth, for they have false notions.
[.86]All those resplendent forms are Siddhāntas, one by one. The souls have the brilliance of lightning, [but they are subjected to] rebirth, o fair-faced one. Thus are these forms, there is no doubt for the mind. 
 [.87]The condensed [exposition] of the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis, in the full sense, is taught by the Lord Paramaśiva.
[.88]O six-faced, know the Three Syllables—a, u, ma—to be the Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, and Svar, as well as Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra. This universe is of such nature. 
 [.89]The reality of the Three Syllables is the universe, called a single reality. You should know it, o reverend Kumāra.
[.90][For he who] listens to the Śaivasiddhānta the fruit of all doctrinal texts come to exist, as well as [of] mudrās, worship, the fire-ritual, and the manifestation of the [divine] light. 
 [.91]The excellence of one who listens to the holy scripture of the Siddhānta being interpreted is as follows: his merit is more than [that derived from reading] all the [other] doctrinal texts, as well as the mudrās and worship.
[.92]The▷ hasitadi regimen of laughter etc., the various sorts of religious practices, and the secret maṇḍalas made of all gods. 
 [.93]Therefore, one should listen to this holy Siddhānta.
[.94]If one performs the Siddhānta in this manner, he obtains the fruit. How much more one who has fallen [into sin], o Goddess: he obtains release, the well-disposed one. 
 [.95]He who practises the holy Siddhānta is released.
[.96]Whether▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya a woman or a Brahman, a warrior or a worker, a servant or even an outcaste, a lame, a hump-backed, or a man with a deformed arm, or one with any kind of inner disease, beginning with epilepsy. 
 [.97]The examples of those who are devoted to practise the holy scriptures of the Siddhānta [are] from an outcaste to an epileptic.
[.98]Having known the condensed [exposition] of the Siddhānta, he is not going to be born again. 
 [.99]The condensed [exposition] of the holy scripture of the Siddhānta is known by the learned master. He is released, for he is not doubtful towards the holy scripture of the Śaivasiddhānta.
[.100]According to the atheistic doctrine, Śiva is not the Supreme God, o Six-faced. There is no doubt about the Siddhānta, [and no] reviling of the Tantra, which is difficult to grasp. 
 [.101]Summing up: the reviling of the reverend Paramaśiva is difficult to grasp.
[.102]The material world, from Brahmā etc., [including] the animate and inanimate living beings, is the Viśva; it should be seen by the six-faced one (i.e., Kumāra) as having become one, o fair-faced one. 
 [.103]The reverend Brahmā etc. is the Viśva (i.e., the oṁ). That is the Siddhānta-Gnosis in material form.
[.104]From Brahmā and Viśva the breath [arises], called the gnosis of Viṣ\-ṇu. It is known as Power of Pervasion. It is called ma. 
 [.105]The ma is Śiva. The Power of Pervasion is the breath in the tip of the nose.
[.106]The Soul is known to [reside] in the right [of the nose]. The Inner Soul is in the left [of the nose]. The Supreme Soul is in the nostrils. [Thus are] the distinguishing features of the divisions of the praṇava. 
 [.107]The holy Soul is in the right side of the nose. The Inner Soul is in the left side of the nose. The Supreme Soul is in the tip of the nose. Thus the characteristics of the holy praṇava are known by the learned master.
[.108]What is called exhalation—the union of the three—is accomplished. The exhalation is the Soul. Thus, it is said to be a lamp. 
 [.109]The union of the holy Soul is exhalation. The breath comes out from the orifices of the nose, the locus where Śiva enters.
[.110]The▷ 11.66 union of the two is called the Soul together with the Lord. Śiva should be known as having been turned into breath. There is no doubt, o fair-faced one.lednopb 
 [.111]The meeting of the holy Soul with the Lord Śiva is the essence of yoga. It is Soul-Śiva as far as the essence of yoga is concerned. That is the union of Soul and Śiva (ātmeśvarasaṅyoga). Therefore, he is wholly unconstrained.
[.112]Having▷ pasupatavratafinal carried out many sorts of observances, the man who proffers the [mantra] siddhānta performs all sorts of actions on the earth, as he pleases. 
 [.113]At will means that he has no hesitations when he performs all the observances.
[.114]†Sometimes▷ pasupatavratafinal he abides in the middle of ashes, sometimes ... his body is garlanded, sometimes [he wears a] colourful [garment and sometimes not] ... sometimes [he performs] the vow of silence and sometimes [he does not] ... having known, he ...† 
 [.115]He is free toward all observances. Thus is his wholly unconstrained [attitude] towards the observances.
[.116]†The▷ pasupatavratafinal knower of reality in the form of a human being, smeared [with ashes] at the three times [of the day] (?) ... dwells [in] the abode of Śiva.† 
 [.117]Thus is the manifestation of the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis to be known.
[.118]The Supreme Śiva is the bile. Sadāśiva is the heart. The Sense-Mind is Brahmā. The Intellect is Viṣṇu, o Pārvatī. 
 [.119]The reality of the holy Siddhānta-Gnosis is recognized [as follows]: the bile, its ontic level is Paramaśiva. The heart is the ontic level of Sadāśiva.
[.120]The Self-Identity is Rudra. [Thus] are the irreproachable five loci. The organ of knowledge (vijñāna) is dissolved †...†, the heart is dissolved in the bile. 
 [.121]The holy Self-Identity [becomes] one with the Intellect. The Intellect dissolves into the Sense-Mind. The Sense-Mind dissolves into the heart. The heart dissolves into the bile.
[.122]The knower of reality knows that Rudra dissolves into Viṣṇu, Viṣṇu dissolves in Brahmā, Brahmā dissolves in Sadāśiva. 
 [.123]The reverend Rudra [becomes] one with the reverend Viṣṇu. He dissolves into the reverend Brahmā. Brahmā dissolves into the reverend Sadāśiva.
[.124]Sadāśiva is dissolved into what is called the Supreme Śiva. Thus the fivefold loci, o Goddess, are one [indeed], free from disease. 
 [.125]This holy reality should be known by the learned master.
[.126]Conduct is the Power of Action, moral precept is known as [the Power of] Knowledge. The knower of the Supreme Reality knows this reality of the Siddhānta. 
 [.127]In short, the holy conduct is the Power of Action. The holy moral precept is the Power of Knowledge. If the learned master knows about the conduct and moral precept, he is called a knower of reality. He is accomplished in the holy scriptures of the Siddhānta.
[.128]The intelligent one, o Goddess, utters the syllables of the Siddhānta-Gnosis, characterized by seven divisions. The seven divisions are proclaimed. 
 [.129]The reality of the holy Siddhānta is the seven syllables. That is why [he] is accomplished.
[.130]The bhurloka is the first division, the bhuvarloka is the second, the svarloka is the third; [these are] standing on the Mahāloka, which is to be known as the fourth by the most excellent learned masters. Jana[loka] is the fifth, Tapo[loka] is the sixth, and Satyaloka is the seventh. 
 [.131]The excellence of his discussion [is as follows:] at the beginning, he is king in the bhurloka. What is heard by him as the second [topic], he is king in the bhuvarloka. The third, he is king in the svarloka. The fourth, he is king in the Mahāloka. Further, as for the fifth, he is king in the Janaloka. What is heard by him as the sixth, he is king in the Tapoloka. The seventh, he is king in the Satyaloka. Such is the one who listens to the discussion of the holy doctrine on the Siddhānta-Gnosis.
[.132]Thus the Siddhānta in [the form of] syllables has been proclaimed to be the Seven Worlds. 
 [.133]The one who listens to the discussion of the holy Siddhānta doctrine is king in the Seven Worlds.
[.134]The sa is the bhurloka. The i is the bhuvarloka. The da is called Svar[loka]. The dha is the Mahāloka. 
 [.135]The holy sa is the bhurloka. The i is the bhuvarloka. The da is called svarloka. The dha is the Mahāloka.
[.136]The a is the Janaloka. The na is the Tapoloka. The ta is the Satyaloka. The Seven Worlds mean the body. 
 [.137]The holy a is the Janaloka. The na is the Tapoloka. The ta is the Satyaloka. They are the embodiment of the Lord Sadāśiva. He dissolves into the Lord Paramaśiva. The Unity dissolves into the reverend Free of Disease.
[.138]Blissful, supreme, subtle, benevolent (śiva), and eternal, o six-faced one: the unparalleled locus of the bile leads to the Supreme, o Goddess. 
 [.139]The reverend Free of Disease is eternally blissful. The holy bile is the locus of the reverend Free of Disease.
[.140]He who desires liberation, o Great Goddess, along with his children and his children’s kinsmen, [obtains] this supreme extinction as well as the eight supernatural powers. 
 [.141]What is called the extinction of Śiva is the state of supreme independence.
[.142]Criminal▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya acts, anger, and even violence, according to his will: he acts as he pleases, o Goddess; he may perform both right and wrong. 
 [.143]The nature of the learned master who knows the reverend Free of Disease is to perform the right and wrong. That is his act of free will.
[.144]Having▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya enjoyed what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten, [i.e.] pure and impure [foods], and having drank liquor, the reverend sage wearing a chignon acts as he pleases, o tuft-haired one. 
 [.145]In short, the learned master should do whatever he pleases. He should not be hesitant toward all [those practices involving] the drinking of what should not be drunk, and the eating of what cannot be eaten. The eating of those [forbidden foods] is [performed] without hesitation.
[.146]Endowed▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya with conduct and moral precepts, he acts as he pleases at all times. 
 [.147]And the good moral precepts, it is his act of free will towards them.
[.148]The▷ bhaksabhaksapeyapeya wise one who wears a chignon desires liberation, o Pārvatī. Free from conduct and moral precepts, he is taught [to be endowed with the Powers of] Action, Knowledge, and Pervasion. 
 [.149]The reality of the reverend Viṣṇu is one wearing a chignon. The reality of the reverend Brahmā is one whose head is shaven. The reality of the reverend Śiva is one wearing a tuft. They are the Power of Knowledge, the Power of Action, and the Power of Pervasion.
[.150]This conduct is manifest, while moral precept is unmanifest indeed. This conduct is observance (vrata), moral precept is virtue (dharma). 
 [.151]The basic essentials of the modes of being of the holy Siddhānta are as follows. It is a division of the praṇava. siddha is the reverend Sadāśiva, anta is the reverend Paramaśiva.
[.152]siddha is declared to be Rudra. anta is the God Sadāśiva. 
 [.153]Another [division] is as follows: siddha is the reverend Rudra, anta is Sadāśiva.
[.154]siddha is declared to be the Action, anta is known as the Knowledge. 
 [.155]siddha is the Power of Action, anta is the Power of Knowledge.
[.156]siddha is to be known as Pervasion, while anta as Sovereignty. 
 [.157]siddha is the Power of Pervasion, anta is the Power of Sovereignty.
[.158]si is to be known as Rudra, ddha as Īśvara. anta is taught to be Śiva. The praṇava is one only. 
 [.159]The mode of being of the holy Siddhānta is threefold. si is Rudra. ddha ia Īśvara. anta is Śiva. The praṇava is a single reality.
[.160]si is known as the flank of the embodiment, while ddha is the heart. anta is taught as the head. [Thus] is proclaimed to be the praṇava. 
 [.161]The reverend Rudra is the embodiment. Īśvara is the heart. The reverend Śiva is the head. Thus is the mode of being of the holy Siddhānta in the body of the practitioner.
[.162]si is said to be Bhūḥ, while ddha the Bhuvaḥ. anta is the Svar. [Such] is the reality called Siddhānta by name. 
 [.163]Here is its other mode of being:
[.164]si is to be known as the Earth, ddha is the Space. anta is taught as the heaven. [This is what] is called Siddhānta by name. 
 [.165]si is Earth. ddha is Space. anta is heaven. [Such] is the mode of being of the threefold world.
[.166]si is in the right side of the nose. ddha is in the left side of the nose. anta is the reality in the tip of the nose. [This is what] is called Siddhānta by name. 
 [.167]si is the right side of the nose. ddha is the left side of the nose. anta is the tip of the nose.
[.168]si is in the right eye. ddha is in the left eye. Know anta to be the third eye. [This is what] is called Siddhānta by name. 
 [.169]si is the right eye. ddha is the right eye. anta is the eye in the middle.
 [.170]si is in the right ear. ddha is in the left ear. anta is in the middle [space] between the ears. [This is what] is called Siddhānta by name. 
 [.171]si is in the right ear. ddha is in the ear in the left. anta is in the middle between the left and right ear.
 [.172]Thus ends the Storehouse of the Worlds, the Supreme Secret Doctrine, the Scripture of the Siddhānta-Gnosis, the Teaching of Śiva.
