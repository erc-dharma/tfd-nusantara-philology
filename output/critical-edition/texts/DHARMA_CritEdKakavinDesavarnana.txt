chapter 1: 
 canto 1: 
 [1.1] 'Hail to the King! Homage be to thee!' - this is the praise of the humble man at the feet of the Lord always. He is present in invisible form at the focus of meditation, he is Śiwa and Buddha, embodied in both the material and the immaterial; As King of the Mountain, Protector of the Protectorless, he is lord of the lords of the world. And as the deity of deities that one sets one's heart upon, the inconceivable of the inconceivable, being and non-being are his expression in theworld.
 [1.2] All-pervading and immanent, representing all the basic principles, he is the epithetless to the Waiṣṇawas; To the yogis he is Īśwara, the universal soul to Kapila, and he is Jambhala manifest as the deity of wealth; He is Wāgindra as the deity of all the sciences, Manasija in the treatises on love. And in putting into practice the removal of obstacles he is Yamarāja, having as the fruit of his deeds the welfare of theworld.
 [1.3] Such is the reason for offering praises at his feet, desiring to compose an account of the ruler. The illustrious King of vilvatikta, King Rājasanagara, the supreme prince. He is plainly an incarnation of the Lord Nātha as he removes the impurities of the realm; The whole land of Java is most devoted and obedient, extending even to othercountries.
 [1.4] It was in the year of the śaka-era 'seasons-arrows-suns' (1256, AD 1334), at his birth, that the prince was already destined to be king. As 'born-to-be-king' Prince of Kahuripan; the signs of his miraculous and extraordinary nature were that The earth quaked and rumbled, there was a rain of ash, thunder and lightning zigzagged through the sky. Mount Kampud erupted and the wretched evildoers were annihilated and died without agasp.
 [1.5] That was the moment when the Lord Girinātha became manifest in the form of a most excellent king; Such is the nature of his reign (?) that the whole of the land of Java has been humbled and bows down in submission. Priests, nobles, middle class, the lowly and the 'four stations' are equally skilled at their allotted duties. And without exception the evildoers have ceased having wicked ideas, out of sheer awe for the king's valour.
 canto 2: 
 [2.1] Now as for the renowned Rājapatnī, she was the King's maternal grandmother. Who was like an embodiment of the goddess Paramabhagawatī, an excellent parasol for the world. Exerting herself in yoga, she practised Buddhist meditation as a nun, venerable and shaven-headed; In śaka 'sight-seven-suns' (1272, AD 1350) she was laid to rest, having passed away and gone to the realm of theBuddha.
 [2.2] At the return of the illustrious Rājapatnī to the Buddha's abode, left behind the world was sad and bewildered; At the accession of the King in Majapahit, it was forthwith content and turned its mind to devotion. The King's mother, Tribhuwana Wijayottunggadewī, took his place. And in the royal compound of Jīwana she nurtured the King.
 canto 3: 
 [3.1] Furthermore she was devoted to the Rājapatnī as her mother; Faithfully she followed the observances of the Buddhists and performed the purificatory ceremonies at the feet of the deceased. Prince Kr̥tawardhana, who is father to the King, is always with her, And as a couple they adhere firmly to the path of the Buddha, bringing about the happiness of theworld.
 [3.2] Now the prince, the King's father, is established in Singhasāri; He is plainly the worthy Ratnasambhawa, as he is unwavering in his Concern for the good of the world. Resolutely he exerts himself for the increase of the world and is loyally devoted to the king; He constantly undertakes the execution of all kinds of judicial affairs and is most expert in matters of policy.
 canto 4: 
 [4.1] And again the King's royal 'mother', the younger sister of the Princess of Jīwana, Is known as Princess Rājadewī Māhārajasa, the irreproachable; She is paid homage in Daha, and is incomparable in appearance and the six good qualities; Together with the Princess of Jīwana they are like Sudewī divided intwo.
 [4.2] Her husband, the Prince of Wəṅkər, like the divine Upendra descended, Is Prince Wijayarājasa, unequalled in his supremely wide knowledge. Together with the Prince of Singhasāri firmly of one mind. He knows all about the distribution of cultivated areas* up and down the entire length ofJava.
   canto 5: 
 [5.1] There is a 'younger sister' of the King of Majapahit, Who is in Lasəm, delightful for her beauty, A daughter of the Princess of Daha, famed as Rājasaduhitendudewī theblameless.
 [5.2] But Wardhanaduhiteśwarī is the youngest. Princess of Pajang, incomparably charming and sweet, A daughter of the Princess of Jīwana, famed as Being plainly a younger sister to the King.
 canto 6: 
 [6.1] The King's brothers-in-law have both received royal consecration: The Prince of Matahun, husband of the Princess of Lasəm, the valiant, as Rājasawardhana, renowned for his handsome appearance and very knowledgeable in policy; Their marriage is no different from Smara and Pinggalā's, praised by theworld.
 [6.2] The Prince of Paguhan is husband of the Princess who is settled in Pajang, Known as Prince Singhawardhana, he is handsome, young and fixed in good ways. A shining example,* their marriage is like that of Sanatkumāra and Iḍā; Devoted to the king and loving toward his cousins, he causes the country to bewell-pleased.
  [6.3] Further, they have as offspring the princess who rules in Wīrabhūmi, Princess Nāgarawardhanī the famed, an incomparable maiden; Her younger brother is Prince of Mataram, like the divine Kumāra come down, Wikramawardhana is the title accorded him by theKing.
 [6.4] The youngest child of the Princess of Pajang is paid homage in the royal compound of Pawwan-awwan; She is Princess Surawardhani, still a little girl and as pretty as a picture. All the princes of Java who each have their own capital Dwell together in vilvatikta, holding the King in their lap.
 canto 7: 
 [7.1] Let us describe the King: He is lauded as being a world-conquering ruler,like
 [7.2]the rays of the sun; His enemies are annihilated like darkness - all that there are in the world
 [7.3]have been swept away by the king. The good, day-lotuses, are content; the wicked, night-lotuses, are closed, loyal and virtuous; Regularly the villages of the whole country give wealth like water, offered by them in due order.
 [7.4] Like the god Śatamanyu pouring rain upon the earth the King wards off the misfortunes of his realm; Like the divine Pitrpati in the chastisement of the ignoble, Baruṇa in the discovery of wealth. He is like the divine Bāyu in penetrating the whole world, making constant use of messengers. Like Pr̥thwī in protecting the palace, and his appearance is like LordCandramā.
 [7.5] In form he is Kāmadewa manifest, come down to view the delights of the palace. And all the leading ladies and royal women are like a multiplication of Ratih. Now the Queen is the excellent Prince Wijayarājasa's own daughter. Most eminent and in appearance Suṣumnadewī‚ incomparable in her beauty and truly a match for theking.
 [7.6] Furthermore they have issue, as they have as daughter Princess Kusumawardhanī, A blameless young princess who is paid homage in the royal compound of Kabalan and is of the utmost charm. Prince Wikramawardhana will be her proper match, as everyone says — They will be like a god and goddess when they marry later, bringing happiness to people'shearts.
 
chapter 2: 
 canto 8: 
 [8.1] Let us describe the layout of the awe-inspiring royal palace: its wall is of red brick, it goes right around and is thick and high. On the western side the 'palace-mouth' faces onto the great square in the midst of deep encircling water. Brahmasthāna each with its own shelter and buddhi trees in rows and neatly shaped, all thick with festoons — Those are the places where the officers constantly take turns at watching over the safety of thecourt.
 [8.2] On the north is the ceremonial gate, splendid and extraordinary, its doors of iron, adorned with countless designs; On the east, to the side of it, there stands a fine, high tower, its base plastered with white cement. Located to the north, but south of the market, close together there stand rest-houses, long in the extreme and very extraordinary. Each month of Caitra the place where the gathered troops assemble; to the south of this is the crossroads, other-worldly in itselegance.
 [8.3] The outer courtyard is wide and spacious; its pavilions are arranged on four sides with a hall in the centre. On the north is the building where the scholars as well as the officials are in attendance, seated in groups; On the east is the place of the Śaiwas and Buddhists, holding debates and uttering formulas with their ritual utensils, packed full; Their purificatory ceremonies at the time of the eclipse of Phālguṇa have as fruit the welfare of the wholeworld.
 [8.4] Located to the east are the places for offerings in rows of three: in the centre is the tall Śaiwa sanctuary; The place for the Wipras is on the south, equally excellent and with storeys; on the West of the courtyard is a platform for offerings to the demons. The place for the Buddhists is on the north; the buildings have three storeys With fine carvings on their pinnacles. Each is thickly adorned With flowers. Where the princes always go in a group when offerings are being made forthem.
 [8.5] There in the interior, to the south of the outer courtyard and separated by a gateway, the audience-halls are arranged; Fine buildings in rows flank the road to the west; in the middle of it spreading tañjung trees are blooming. On the west, again walled off, to the south of the tower, various open pavilions extend around the sides; It is very broad and in the centre of the courtyard of the maṇḍapa are the cages of countless cocks, constantlycrowing.
 [8.6] Further into the interior the southern audience-hall leads directly into the Second Gate in the inner apartments; Its arrangement is in terraces — each section is separated by a gateway, constructed so. All the buildings have a solidly built foundation, and their pillars, planks and rafters are without defect; They are crowded with the King's troops coming on duty in turn to stand guard, taking heed of the appointed time and alert.
  canto 9: 
 [9.1] These are the kinds of men in attendance, called Pangalasan and [in] countless in number: Tan Palvir, Nyū Gading, Janggala, Kaḍiri, Sədah, Panglarang, Rājadewī, Waiśangka, Wwang Panewwan, Kr̥tapura, Sinəlir, Jayêng Prang, Jayâgə̄ng, Angreyok, Kayw apu, Wwang Jaladhi, Pasuruhan, Samajâdi andPrakīrṇa.
 [9.2] Those are the main ones in the pavilions in the square, constantly taking turns; Officers and headmen. King's troops as well as orderlies are outside in great numbers. More prominent are the ones stationed at the Second Gate, the eminent Bhayangkāri who guard the door in a large group; Their place is to the north of the door into the interior, and to the south of it are the nobles andscholars.
 [9.3] There on the north-west and to the west, going round to the Direction of Death (south), the many rest-houses Are crowded with leading officials in charge, put at the head of the Wīra(bhūmi) servants when they are in attendance. Others are located to the south, the division being the doorway; the mandapa and the many buildings Are constantly crowded with the servants of the Prince of Paguhan as they come to payhomage.
 [9.4] Within the Second Gate its fine courtyard is level, wide and very splendid. Crowded with buildings and the amazing halls where those coming to attend audience in the interior gather. On the east is the incomparable building, its construction radiant, high and fully adorned. The place where the King gives audience to those who have come into the presence in the countless halls.
  canto 10: 
 [10.1] Let us give a description of those who are in attendance in the halls without interruption: The senior officials, the high-born and the titled close by. And the Five of Majapahit: the Mapatih, Dəmung and Kanuruhan, Together with the Rangga and Tumənggung, as the highest of those who come into the presence, completely filling theplace.
 [10.2] The number of weṣapurī among the residences of officials of the amātya class in the whole capital is the subject of conversation of the Apatihs and Dəmungs whenever they gather. Only the commanders of the companies of Pangalasans have a fixed limit: Five is the number of the blameless officials who keep watch over the activities of the innerapartments.
 [10.3] Now the nobles and scholars, sages and priests, whenever they come into the presence. There in the shade of the aśoka trees, by the side of the halls, they stand. The two religious administrators and the seven interpreters in a group Are the ones whose actions are truly noble and, bearing the title 'the Noble', are worthy of imitation.
  canto 11: 
 [11.1] These are the ones Who are in attendance in the halls that serve astheir
 [11.2]Interior, neatly arranged and splendidly adorned; Within, to the east of the First Gate, those Who are inmates of the Interior are secluded far away: Prince Singhawardhana is on the south, with his wife, sons and daughters. And on the north Prince Kr̥tawardhana – just as in heaven there are three compounds in a group.
 [11.3] Of all the buildings none lack pillars bearing fine carvings and coloured. And the substructures of red brick are carved in relief, closely fitted and shaped. All around are the products of the potter, serving as highest point of the roofs of the main buildings. And tañjung, keśara and campaka are the most prominent of the flowering trees that thickly festoon the courtyards.
  canto 12: 
 [12.1] Let us describe the layout of the 'bulwarks', arranged along the sides of the city: On the east are the Śaiwa priests, and their head is His Eminence the Brahmarāja; In the south are the Buddhists, and their head is the Abbot of Nadī; On the west are the nobles, officials and chiefs of the same kin as theKing.
 [12.2] To the east but separated by a field is the compound of the Prince of Wəngkər, most amazing. Like Indra and Śacī the prince is there with the Princess of Daha. The Prince of Matahun and the Princess of Lasəm dwell within, not apart. Located on the south, not far away, is their accommodation, bright andbeautiful.
 [12.3] There in the north, northwards of the great market, there are quarters fine and splendid. He who is as it were a younger brother to the Prince of Wəngkər is the one established there. Loyal and devoted to the princes, steadfast and versed in matters of policy, he is Patih of Daha; Known to people by the name of Lord Narapati, he is an ornament of therealm.
 [12.4] To the north-east are the quarters of Gajah Mada, excellent Patih of Majapahit, An officer valiant, discerning in tactics, with a firm foundation in loyalty and devotion to the King, Eloquent and skilled in speech, polite and patient, constantly exerting himself, unremitting. The superintendent of royal affairs, he watches over the King's position as supreme ruler of theworld.
 [12.5] Now to the south of the royal compound are the quarters of the administrators of religious law, very fitting. On the east of course the Śaiwas as highest, and the Buddhists on the west, nicely arranged. We need not describe the quarters of the other leading officers or of the nobles. Because of their number, each one distinguished by his own quarters, an ornament to thecity.
 [12.6] The royal compound at Majapahit the incomparable is as sun and moon. And the courtyards of the many quarters, each with its own particular charm, are rays of light in relation to it. Like the stars and planets are the various remaining cities, Daha the foremost. And the other islands and all the surrounding countries which seek refuge and in numbers come into the presence.

chapter 3: 
 canto 13: 
 [13.1] The islands and lesser islands, in the first place coming under the territory of the Malay lands, Are Jambi and Palembang, Karitang, Təba and Dharmāśraya following them, Kaṇḍis, Kahwas, Manangkabwa, Siyak, Rəkan, Kampar and Pane, Kampe, Haru and Maṇḍahiling, Tumihang, Parlak andBarat,
 [13.2] Lwas and Samudra, as well as Lamuri, Batan, Lampung and Barus – Those are the main ones among the Malay lands; all these countries are subject and obedient. Besides these there is the island of Tañjungnagara: Kapuhas and Katingan, Sampit and Kūṭalingga, as well as Kūṭawaringin, Sambas and Lawai.
  canto 14: 
 [14.1] Kaḍangḍangan, Laṇḍa and Saməḍang and Tirəm as well, Sedu, Buruneng, Kalka, Saluḍung, Solot and Pasir, Baritu, Sawaku and also Tabalung, Tuñjung and Kute, as well as Malano, the principal place beingTañjungpurī.
 [14.2] In the territory of Pahang the main places are Hujung and Medini,* Ləngkasukha and Sai as well as Kalantən and Tringgano, Naśor‚ Paka, Muwar, Dungun, Tumasik and Sang Hyang Hujung, Kəlang, Kəda, Jəre, Kañjap and Niran, the Whole region as agroup,
  [14.3] To the east of the island of Java, this too should be mentioned: Bali with as leading places Baḍahulu and Lvā Gajah, Gurun with as main places Sukun, Taliwang, Ḍompo and Sapi, Sang Hyang Api, Bhīma, Śeran,* Hutan and Kaḍali* as agroup.
  [14.4] Also those in the whole island of Gurun, called Lombok Mirah, and those in Saksak, the main one being Lun, all principalities. As well as the land of Bantayan, led by Bantayan and Luwuk, including Uḍa, these being the three foremost places in theisland.
 [14.5] Taking them island by island: Makasar, Butun and Banggawi, Kunir. Galiyahu and Salaya, Sumba, Solot and Muwar, as well as Waṇḍan, Ambwan, Maloko andWwanin,
  canto 15: 
 [15.1] Those are the other areas under the protection of the King; Even so, Syangka, Ayodhyapura, not to mention Dharmanagari, Marutma and Rājapura and especially Singhanagari, Campa, Kamboja and Yawana are alwaysfriends.
 [15.2] However, the island of Madura does not follow the other royal compounds. Because of the fact that it was one with the land of Java in former times. 'Ocean-supports-the earth' (124, AD 202) is its chronogram, one hears, The moment when it became divided; their essence is one, not farapart.
 [15.3] More and more the other islands pay homage to the King, And regularly bring contributions of product-tax each month. From the efforts the King makes to ensure its good management, Scholars and officials are always being sent out to carry off the tribute.
  canto 16: 
 [16.1] It was the custom for the scholars who used to go to the other regions to be forbidden to undertake their own affairs, as they would without question be the loser. It was allowed, if on the King's orders, to go to any destination, however, to establish the doctrines of Śiwa, so that people should not stray from thepath.
 [16.2] Whereas we scholars of the Buddhist discipline, it is well known, even though it be on royal orders, may not travel in just any direction. All the areas to the west of the land of Java are forbidden; there is after all no Buddhist in the past whom it is possible to take asprecedent.
 [16.3] Nevertheless of the other regions to the east of Java, Gurun and Bali are the main ones where it is allowed to go. The agreement of the great sage Bharaḍa of course stands, made with Kuturan, lord of sages, of famousrepute.
 [16.4] Because the scholars' travels have been disposed in this way, those who are sent to the west and to the east already have their proper procedure, as evidence of carrying out all the King's commands. All the clergy whenever they talk about something are a delight to those who seethem.
 [16.5] Then the other countries, all that were under the care of Java, obeyed the King's commands and each was true in what it did. Furthermore any that transgressed his commands was attacked and wiped out completely by the squadrons of the various meritorious navalofficers.
 
chapter 4: 
 canto 17: 
 [17.1] The King's rule over the land of Java having grown firmer and firmer, victorious over the other regions. It is there in Majapahit that he receives homage, bringing about the welfare of the world. In vast numbers he has created rest-houses, pious foundations and temples, to bring happiness to others. And officials, priests and scholars are the ones given the authority to join in performing meritorious acts in theworld.
 [17.2] An abundance of valour and sovereign power has been appropriated bythe
 [17.3]King, in very truth the highest of rulers; at his ease, he has no cares while indulging in pleasures to his heart's desire. The most beautiful maidens in Janggala and Kadiri are selected as he sees fit. Not to mention those carried off from other cities — the most lovely are taken into the palace.
 [17.4] The length and breadth of the land of Java are like one city under the ruleof
 [17.5]the King; thousands are the dwellings of men which like the tents of an army encircle the flanks of the city. The various other islands are like the countryside, made happy and treated with gentleness. And the wooded mountains are like the park — he roams through them all without concern.
 [17.6] Every time at the end of the cold season he sets out to roam throughthe
 [17.7]countryside: there is a cultivated area called Sīma, to the south of Jalagiri, going eastwards from the city; it is busy, for this is the place where everyone goes to make vows at the time of the cockfights, and so there is never a break — Also Wewe, Pikatan and Caṇḍi Lima are places he always heads for, contentedly travelling about.
 [17.8] Otherwise he goes to Palah to come into the presence of the divine Lord of the Mountain with devotion and reverence. And it is fitting to go further on to Balitar, to Jimur and to Śilâhrit to enjoy the scenery. The main place in Daha is Polaman, and Kuwu and Linggamarabangun he always visits. And when in Janggala the King constantly frequents Surabhaya, and then goes on toBuwun.
 [17.9] In Śaka 'dice-date-suns' (1275, AD 1353) the King went on a trip toPajang,
 [17.10]attended by all the city; in Śaka 'body-mountains-suns' (1276, AD 1354) he went to Lasəm, travelling by way of the seashore. In 'openings-mountains-ears-moon' (1279, AD 1357) he enjoyed the beauties by the Southern Ocean, going straight along the edge of the woods. And there he toured through Loḍaya, Tətə̄r and Siḍəman, taking note of their scenic beauties.
 [17.11] But in Śaka 'moon-elephant-suns' (1281, AD 1359) in the month of Bhadrapada, at the fullness of the moon. King Rājasanāgara went on a journey to Lamajang, to take note of all there was to see. All the princes of Java with their wives again went with the King, with servants and vehicles; officials and officers from the whole of Majapahit and in particular the King's priests and court poets accompaniedhim.
 [17.12] So this man by the pen-name of Prapañca joined in the pursuit of beauty, attending at the feet of the King, just as the poet (himself), son of the poet, is pleased to be accompanied (by others) and receives kindly those who muse. He is Superintendent of Religious Affairs for the Buddhists to the King, and has succeeded his father, whom all the Buddhist priests had as head and whose actions in the past they keep inmind.
 [17.13] Now as for the way the poet came before the King when he was aboy,
 [17.14]serving attentively without error. His motive was after all to follow the King wherever he went in the hope of being favoured. But he still does not know how to achieve poetic effects, and is most unlikely to succeed in composing a song on the writing-tablet. And this is the reason why he describes all the places passed through and sets out their names in order along the road.
 [17.15] The first to be passed through and described is Japan, where there are monasteries and a funerary monument which is completely ruined; to the east are Təbu, Pāṇḍawan, Daluwang, Babala and Kañci not far on. And also the monasteries of Ratnapangkaja, Kuṭi Haji and Kuṭi Pangkaja as well. And Pañjrak, Maṇḍala* and Pongging, Jingan and Kuwu Hañar by the side of theroad.
 [17.16] *Or should one imagine Pañjrakmaṇḍala?
 [17.17] Having reached the foundation at Pañcaśāra he went on and arrivedin
 [17.18]Kapulungan where he spent the night. But the poet journeyed on and spent the night at Waru, Həring and Tīra not far on; their relation to the mother house at Surayaśa is a dependency, and they are listed as such. But they have been transferred temporarily and not yet returned, and so they remembered to be most hospitable to the poet.
 canto 18: 
 [18.1] When the King set out from Kapuluṅan the royal servants attended himin
 [18.2]great numbers. And the whole breadth of the royal highway was filled with a limitless number of laden carriages standing like a solid wall. Man on man, footman on footman they came with ox-carts before and behind. While other followers went on foot, crowded, confused and jostling, with elephants, horses and so on in vast numbers.
 [18.3] Despite the great numbers the carriages could be counted because oftheir
 [18.4]different signs. Furthermore they travelled in contingents and their painting varied from one official to another. The foremost official being the Patih of Majapahit, the 'pedestal of the kingdom'; the hundreds of carriages they rode in had dozens of different marks:
 [18.5] As for the Princess of Pajang, all her carriages bore the mark of thebright
 [18.6]sun. And the Princess of Lasəm's teeming carriages were painted with a splendid white bull. The Princess of Daha had the sign of a sadaha-flower, and her carriages glowed with gold paint. But the main one was the Princess of Jīwana, whose carriages all bore as mark masses of lobheng ləwih.
 [18.7] Now the King of Majapahit's carriages were numberless and bore asmark
 [18.8]the bäel, adorned with canopies of red lobheng ləwih gringsing painted with gold. All the various chiefs transported the King's wives, in the first place Her Majesty the Queen. And as for all the wives of the lower officials, their carriages were permitted to form the vanguard of each contingent.
 [18.9] At the rear there came the carriage of the King, adorned with gold and glowing jewels; its appearance was different: it was a palanquin with screens, with gleaming lac, broad, and its brightness shining roundabout, dazzling. Vast numbers of troops from the Janggala, Kaḍiri and Seḍah Panglarang* companies escorted him in serried ranks. Not to mention the Bhayangkāri** who were in charge, or the other servants who were stationed with the elephants and horses.
 [18.10] *In 9.1, Robson translates "Janggala, Kaḍiri, Sədah, Panglarang".
 [18.11] **OJED gives bhayaṅkari, which is the expected Sanskrit spelling.
 [18.12] Having arrived at Pañcuran Mungkur the carriages made a halt there inthe
 [18.13]morning. And the poet turned off to call in at Sawungan to pay a visit out of concern for a member of his family; when the sun was sinking he set out, in time to meet the King passing by on his way. And following the road to the east they soon arrived at Watu Kiken and made a halt at Matañjung.
 [18.14] Remote Buddhist villages drew near by the edge of the road where thetrees
 [18.15]were sparse; to enumerate them, they were Galanggang as well as Baḍung not far off and Barungbung; even Er Maṇik was there – it too falls under the domain of Yānatraya, it recalls.
 [18.16]And the Superintendent was promptly regaled by them with food and drink, to his satisfaction.
 [18.17] Having reached Kulur and Batang, the King now went on to Gaṅan Asəm; the holy sun grew cooler and at about the seventh hour (4.30 p.m.) was dimmed, veiled by a spreading mist. At a camp in the midst of a grassy field the King was presently lodged. Refreshments arrived and after he had eaten we ordinary people each went to our own abode.
  canto 19: 
 [19.1] When the King set out next morning he came to Bhayalangə̄, where he spent three nights. Leaving there, and having passed through Kədung Dawa bustling with the dwellings of men. He travelled through Lampəs, Timəs and the monastery of Pogara, wherethe
 [19.2]open spaces were firm. And at the Maṇḍala of Hambulu Traya as far as Ḍaḍap the carriages went straight on together.
 [19.3] There is a famous Buddhist foundation, Madakaripura, renowned for its beauty, a freehold granted by the King to the Patih, Gajah Mada, its layout of the highestorder.
 [19.4]This is where the King betook himself, and his rest-house was put into good order and beautifully decorated; arriving by way of Trasuṅay he bathed at Capahan and worshipped at the holy bathing-place.
  canto 20: 
 [20.1] The Buddhist villages arrived and all offered food and drink to the King; enumerated, they were: the whole of Gapuk, an established domain of Iśānabajra, Gantən, Poh, Capahan, Kalampitan, Lumbang, Kuran, We Pətang, and Pañcar, all dependencies of the monastery of Muṅguh and vying to pay theirrespects.
 [20.2] They were joined by the villages of Tuṅgilis and Pabayəman, as theirother
 [20.3]comrades with them; their position as dependencies of the monastery of Ratnapangkaja is on the list and will duly be enjoyed. Those are the eleven Buddhist dependencies which have the confirmed status of kuwu; their privilege is that they observe the celebrations of the Eighth, which was already the arrangement in former times.
 canto 21: 
 [21.1] Passing over this, in the morning they left – let the villages passed through be mentioned: Lo Paṇḍak, Ranu Akuning, Balərah* and Baru-bara, Ḍawəhan, Kapayəman, Tələpak and Barəmi, reaching Sapang and Kasaduran, heading forPawijungan.
 [21.2] *correct Balerah.
 [21.3] They passed through the ravine of Babo* Runting and Pasawahan, and reached Jalāḍi, Patalap as well as Paḍali, Arənon, Panggulan, Payaman and Təpasana; they came to Rəmbang and reached Kamirahan on the shore of thesea.
 [21.4] *correct Bobo.
  canto 22: 
 [22.1] At Ḍampar and at Patuñjungan the King relaxed and made his way along the beach. To the east his path followed the level sands which were so firm that the carriages could drive over them. He made a halt on the banks of a lake thick with white and red lotuses in flower. And was absorbed in watching the giant shrimps moving about in the limpid water, clearly visible in thedepths.
 [22.2] We need not describe the charms of the lake, flowing in rivulets into the sea; departing from there he came to Wədi Guntur, hidden by the side of the road. The Buddhists of Bajraka are a dependency of Taladhwaja and have been properly listed as such. But their companions at Patuñjungan have been 'borrowed' by soldiers and not yet returned to themonastery.
 [22.3] These he passed by and went on eastwards again, skirting the woods along the seashore; he halted at Palumbwan to hunt for a while and then went on with the sun declining. Then he passed the river at Rabut Lawang just when the surf happened to be low. And entered the territory of Balater, where he casually retired for the night on thebeach.
 [22.4] Next morning going via Kunir and Basini he soon reached Saḍeng wherehe
 [22.5]lodged. And for some days was absorbed in amusing himself at Sarampwan enjoying the scenery. Departing from there the King came directly to Kuṭa Bacok where he disported himself on the shore. Absorbed in looking at the rocks engulfed by waves with showers of spray resembling rain.
 [22.6] Even so the poet did not go to Kuṭa Bacok but suddenly followed a branch in the road. Going north from Saḍeng by way of Balung, heading for Tumbu and Habət, on again to Galagah and Tanpahing; at Rəṇəs he waited and spent the night, wishing to attend audience. And so he met up with the King, who went via Jayakr̥ta through Wanagriya and straight on.
  canto 23: 
 [23.1] Through Ḍoni, Bəṇṭong, Puruhan and Bacək, Pakis Haji, Paḍangan and Səcang, through Jāti Gumlar via Śilā Bango, northwards to Dewarame and so toḌukun.
 [23.2] On again he journeyed and arrived in Pakambangan, where the King stayed the night, and soon went on to Tamangsil,* the beginning of the territory of Ḍaya, which he entered quickly and arrived at JurangDaləm.
 [23.3] What is Robson's source for this reading?
 [23.4] The road, just at the point where it runs northward from the sea, over its whole length was rough and narrow; on top of this it rained, so that the steep places became slippery.* And some of the carriages came loose and collided with eachother.
 [23.5] Or: 'On top of that it rained, the reason why all of those (roads) became slippery'?
 canto 24: 
 [24.1] Even so good time was made: when at Palayangan they seemed to beflying
 [24.2]far away. And at Bangkong they looked down and saw where they would spend the night and went swiftly on. The people seeking shelter strove to reach Śaraṇa, and others promptly arrived at Surabha — the attendants were eager to get there.
 [24.3] At sunset it became dim, a hindrance* to their coming into Alang-alang, and when they made a stop at Caṇḍi the oxen would go no further, some of them exhausted, unwilling with fatigue. Then their journey* took them northwards — Turayan was the village passed. But their departure was equally brisk, as they looked forward eagerly to reachingPatukangan.
 [24.4] *Rather: "The setting (sirəp = surup) of the dim (manda) sun was a hindrance ...".
 [24.5] *vehicle?
  canto 25: 
 [25.1] It would take too long to tell all about the accompanying servants andofficials.
 [25.2]Instead the royal family's arrival in Patukangan is now described. There on the shore of the sea to the west the lontar-palms were closely planted and it was wide and level. The place was located to the north of the encampment, and it was here that the King lodged.
 [25.3] All the officials of the outer districts took their places in the camp.* And the Superintendent of the Pasangguhan, Wangśādhirāja, came forward to pay his respects. Together with the blameless Upapatti Ḍang Ācārya Uttama,* the incomparable, and the Śaiwa apañji Mapañji Sāntara, learned in the scriptures and a knowledgeablepoet.
 [25.4] *Should one take both sakveh and kabeh seriously, and imagine a translation "... took their places in all the camps"?
 [25.5] *Uttara. Robson's translation here and note on p. 112 ("uttama: is this really the man's name?") suggest a typing error occurred at some stage of his work that he failed to notice.
  canto 26: 
 [26.1] But the main one was Sang Ārya Śūrādhikāra, appointed regent of the camp; All the people from the dependent territories of Patukangan had arrived before long. Vying with each other in presenting gifts, and so they were given clothing and were well-pleased. Their pleasure caused the King pleasure, and they were pleased to be comfortably settled in thecamp.
 [26.2] There was a construction in the form of a pier extending from aheadland
 [26.3]into the sea. The various houses of bamboo matting were arranged in rows and their yards were wide, looking like an island from the distance. Its pathway stood on piles which were only dimly visible and seemed to be swaying with the movement of the waves. This then was the meritorious work performed by the Ārya in preparation for His Majesty's coming.
  canto 27: 
 [27.1] There the King came to allay the feelings of heat when the sun's rayswere
 [27.2]sharp. Plainly a god and a goddess, as he kept close company with his loved one. Their maid-servants were like nymphs just come down from the sky together, and those who saw it imagined that their impurities would be wiped away and appeared to be utterly amazed.
 [27.3] Manifold were the kinds of sports that the King arranged as amusement.* And he set up anything that would make the village people happy. Every time he was carried away by the martial exercises it made the onlookers speechless. Indeed he was simply a divinity descended as he roamed theworld.
 [27.4] * ... that the happy King arranged.
 canto 28: 
 [28.1] When he had been some time at Patukangan, the officials from Bali and Madura arrived; those from Balumbungan and Andəlan were the first. And the whole of East Java came before him in agroup.
 [28.2] Out of devotion they brought gifts, competing with each other: pigs, sheep, buffaloes, oxen, chickens and dogs in plenty. As well as cloth which they carried in one after another in piles. Those who saw it were amazed, as if they could not believe theireyes.
 [28.3] The next morning is now described: the King distributed gifts of clothing to all the troops. And all the poets were also given them; people were pleased and praised him for it.
 canto 29: 
 [29.1] But only the poet by the pen-name of Prapañca was sad and unceasingly sorrowful, because the poet and Buddhist interpreter Mapañji Kr̥tayaśa had died. He was a colleague in the arts to him and kind to his companion in diligent practice – he had always valued highly the literary works that he bought, put into good order and guardedwell.
 [29.2] I had imagined that I would find him in good health and that he wouldtake
 [29.3]me around to see the sights. Surely he would know where we might go on a trip to compose and leave behind some verse. Once when he was going to die he had recovered – the mistake was that this illness was treated lightly; but he was dead when I arrived, and this made me exceedingly miserable and dejected.
 [29.4] That is the reason I left immediately to go to Kəṭa,* joining those going ahead; Tal Tunggal, Halalang Dawa, Pacaran** and Bungatan we passed. Arriving in Toya Rungun and Walaṇḍingan we headed for Tarapas to spend the night. And in the morning went straight on via Ləmah Bang and shortly after reachedKəṭa.
 [29.5] * Hadi Sidomulyo 2007: 65-66 "Posisi Ketha sudah diketahui, yaitu tanjung Ketah, di sebelah utara Besuki; sedangkan Bungatan dan Walandhingan dapat disamakan dengan desa Bungatan dan Mlandingan, letak masing-masing 15km dan 25 km di sebelah barat Panarukan, di jalan raya menuju Besuki."
 [29.6] **Why not Pacaron?
  canto 30: 
 [30.1] When the King set out to go westwards again the account is resumed: he swiftly arrived in Kəṭa and it was about five nights he stayed; at his ease he described the sea, having again found a pier. But did not neglect to make others happy, for he set his heart onthis.
 [30.2] All the officials of Kəṭa came to pay their respects and, being an Ārya, the one who gave the commands was Ārya Wīraprāṇa as the foremost of them, with the Śaiwa and Buddhist interpreters joining in. And all the people of the dependent territories attended them in numbers, coming without being called; they bore gifts of food, and were all well-pleased when they were given fine clothes.
 canto 31: 
 [31.1] When he departed from Kəṭa the numbers of servants escorting him increased; the way lay through Bañu Həning, and in crowds they arrived in Sampora, as well as Daləman, on to Wawaru and Binor in a flash, Gəbang Kərəp and Gəlam, on to Kalayu to attend to a royalceremony.
 [31.2] Kalayu is a freehold foundation, a permanent Buddhist establishment; The person who was once enshrined there is a highly eminent, noble relative of the King. The reason for the celebration was that the King's work is the performance of the highest law. And as is well known 'cutting the warp'* is the very best way of doing one's sacredduty.
 [31.3] * Note occurrence of the same expression in the Tarukan inscription (1203 Śaka). Any way it can mean committing suicide at least in that context?
 [31.4] The performance of prescribed rites and ceremonies occurred in dueorder
 [31.5] When his celebration was over the King turned to satisfying his every desire; He went into all the nearby villages and visited them unannounced. Several nights he spent there, devoting himself to happiness 'for the good of others': handsome wives he won, the choice of perfectmaidens.
 [31.6] When he left Kalayu, he went straight on through Kutugan, and quickly through Kəbwan Agëng, and soon lodged at Kambang Rawi. This foundation is a Buddhist establishment, and its layout is splendid and fine, a grant made by the King to the eminent Apatih PuNāla.
 [31.7] The offerings made by the Patih were exceedingly fine and faultless; we pass over the King's meal there and tell of the next morning: he set out and went via Haləsəs, Barang and Patuñjungan, and then through Patəntənan, Tarub and swiftly straight on through Lesan.
  canto 32: 
 [32.1] The King soon arrived in Pajarakan where he stayed for fourdays;
 [32.2]The grassy field to the south of the Buddhist foundation was where they set up camp.
 [32.3]The officials and King's priests led by the excellent Ārya Sujana came forward to pay their respects. And having offered him refreshments and food they were given money, which pleased them.
 [32.4] When the King departed to go on, it was the forest hermitage of Sāgarathat
 [32.5]he headed for; his way southward was steep, passing through the riverbed of Buluh, as well as the religious community of Gəḍe, and soon after he betook himself to Sāgara: it was splendid and extraordinary, in the midst of the wooded mountains, its layout bewilderingly beautiful.
 [32.6] But the poet was not in constant attendance upon the King, as hewas
 [32.7]absorbed in enjoying the beautiful scenery: wandering light-heartedly, lost in thought, carefree, forgetting all else, dried up, filled with aversion and indifferent to what ought to be done. Yielding and not mindful of the teachings that apply when following the rules of those who practise diligently, idly he sauntered back and forth through the rows of yards of the festooned
 [32.8]rest-houses.
 [32.9] He reached a shelter by the end of a gallery where the tepus plantshad
 [32.10]joined up and were thick and luxuriant. And to his heart's content he read again and again what those who compose verse in kakawin form had incised there. All the buildings had their share of improvised poems and carefully conceived pen-names on them. And the five letters at the end of the poems were deliberately disguised so as to make a lovely effect.
 [32.11] The bwat-ranten pavilion bore several paintings of stories and had a baseof
 [32.12]stone, polished and high; Flowers of the nāgakusuma tree lay thick in the yard, the sides of which were lined with a wall of stone. Andwang, karawira, kayu mās and mənur were its festoons, as well as kayu puring. And ivory coconut-palms, yellow and low and bearing fruit, stood in the corners, creating a beautiful effect.
 [32.13] It would take too long to tell of the beauty of the forest hermitage that seemed like a vision; Its layout within and without was most awesome because the buildings were roofed with palm-fibre. And all the hermits and especially the nuns, young and old, were virtuous and clever. So that one was freed from defects and impurities merely looking at them, as if viewing Śiwa's abode made visible.
 canto 33: 
 [33.1] The King made a tour of the hermitage and was at once hospitably received by the great sage incumbent there, who spoke with moving words; he gave as refreshments whatever he himself consumed in the hermitage. And the King duly repaid him with money, muchpleased.
 [33.2] Conversing together they discussed the essence of the priestly life, each revealing the contents of his heart, withholding nothing. At last they went out for a stroll and visited every lovely place, causing the hermits and nuns to be well-pleased, looking on inamazement.
 [33.3] When he had finished enjoying the scenery he told the ascetic he wouldgo
 [33.4]back. And as he emerged to go on his way he was deeply attracted at seeing those left behind. The young and pretty hermit-girls remained behind pining every one -- They imagined he was the God of Love come down to seduce them, they were so in love.
  canto 34: 
 [34.1] When the King had returned the hermitage was left sad and dreary. Its bamboos wailed, their eyes swollen and red, and they forgot about their skirts; The sərəh-vine gave itself up to weeping, and the jungle-fowl shrieked. The flow of the tal-palms was like tears, and the beo-birds were tiresome as theycomplained.
 [34.2] The King's advance was checked from time to time, being too quick, forhe
 [34.3]was going down; Numbers of fine buildings he passed on the way, and having left them behind.
 [34.4]Soon he arrived at Ārya, where he waited one night. And in the morning headed northwards and then arrived in Geṇḍing.
 [34.5] The officials of the outer regions headed by Ārya Singhādhikāra and especially the Śaiwas and Buddhists there Made gifts of food, immaculate and with due ceremony. Which the King repaid with gold, clothing and titles, beingpleased.
 [34.6] For a very long time the King continued to await the right moment; He engrossed himself in activities within the camps. When he set out he went by way of Loh Gaway and Sumaṇḍing, Borang, Banger and Barəmi, following the former route but in a westerly direction.
  canto 35: 
 [35.1] However, on coming to Pasuruhan he turned off southwards toKapañangan,
 [35.2]And then following the main road the carriages arrived together in Andoh Wawang, And Kêḍung Pəluk as well as Hambal, the last of the villages to be noted. At once the King headed for the royal sanctuary at the palace of Singhasāri to lodge there.
 [35.3] But Prapañca stayed behind to the west of Pasuruhan, thinking only of amusing himself: The monastery called Darbani on village land of the village of Hujung, This hc visited and enquired with the Abbot about its dependencies and possessions; The latter showed him the document, a fine charter which he read out and which gave him clearerinsight:
 [35.4] The lands at Hepit, with all their valleys and hills respectively, fall withinthe
 [35.5]dependencies of the monastery. And half of Markaman, with ricefields at Balungkur, and with more at Hujung. The substance of the charter aroused a desire in the poet to withdraw from the capital - In the absence of good deeds from former lives he was consequently poor and would take refuge in the monastery of Darbam.
 [35.6] His reason for quickly setting out after the priest had regaled him andthen
 [35.7]going straight off Was to resume his duties in Singhasāri, remembering to pay his respects in the royal presence. The King had completed his flower-offerings within the sanctuary and now
 [35.8]devoted himself to pleasures: Sometimes in Kəḍung Biru at the Abode of the Heavenly Nymphs, or at Buréng taking note of the beautiful scenery.
 canto 36: 
 [36.1] Duly at an auspicious time he left Singhasāri and went south to Kagenəngan, To offer devotion to the lord of the sanctuary, with all his various groups of people following. Money, refreshments and food accompanied his flower-offerings with all the properrequisites.
 [36.2]As well as clothing carried on poles preceded by drums - the people who saw it were delighted.
 [36.3] When he had completed his worship he came outside and wassurrounded
 [36.4]by his subjects who came before him in order; The Śaiwa and Buddhist priests and the Ārya were seated here by his side, not far off. We pass over the time when the King took his meal, enjoying himself to the full; The King's troops, as many as appropriate, were given fine clothing, and this deeply moved those who saw it.
  canto 37: 
 [37.1] Let us describe the condition of the temple: its layout is matchless. On the outside is a very splendid gateway with a surrounding wall, its height measureless; Inside its courtyard is terraced, the fine rest-houses arranged around its edge. And thick with all kinds of flowering trees - fine bakula, nāgakusuma and so on - like avision.
 [37.2] The tower-temple in the centre seems amazingly fitting, other-worldly andas
 [37.3]tall As Mount Meru, a Śaiwa sanctuary with an image of Śiwa within. The reason why Lord Girināthaputra serves as chosen deity in visible form Is his relation as ancestor to the King, being an object of reverence for the whole world.
 [37.4] Now there is in the southern part of the temple, within it, anabandoned
 [37.5]sanctuary - See its walls and gateway, equally high - it must once have belonged to the Buddhists. Inside it is a stair-c/angka, its platform remains on the east but has collapsed on the west; Only its shrine is still whole, and the place of worship is in good order, of red brick and high.
 [37.6] See how to the north of the platform of the stair its remaining earth isalready
 [37.7]level; The nāgapuspa planted there are spreading and others in the courtyard are sprouting and budding. Outside the gate the refectory is high, but its grounds arc abandoned. Its broad courtyard is covered with grass, its path is overgrown with weeds and full of mosses.
 [37.8] Like a woman suffering from a serious ailment, languishing with passion,the
 [37.9]lintel sculpture is wan and pale. The casuarinas let their hair hang loose, dishevelled and disordered, being always blown in the wind. The ivory coconut-palms still have yellow ointment smeared on their leaf-sheaths, and the betel-nuts are lustreless and faded. And the ivory bamboo too is feeling feeble at the loss of its skirt, sighing incessantly.
 [37.10] It is distressing to see how there is nothing that can serve as a remedy for it -It is only the illustrious Hayam Wuruk who is awaited as a cause of bringing it back to life. For he has achieved a state of excellence and has mastered the best way of bringing happiness to the world. He is kindly disposed to the humble and always takes pity on those who have been afflicted by misfortune, a deity in visibleform.
 [37.11] Let us return to the description of the King's journey: the next morning he went to the foundation at Kiḍaḥ And having paid reverence to the Lord in the afternoon he then went straight on to Jajaghu. After he had again come before the holy image of the Buddha, in the evening he lodged there. And in the morning he went back to Singhasāri, and without tiring made a stop atBurəng.
 
chapter 5: 
 canto 38: 
 [38.1] The charm of Bureng is the lake that wells up clear and blue: A candi of stone with surrounding wall has been arranged in the midst of it. And numerous are the rest-houses that stand on the edge and the festoons of flowers; It is always the destination of wanderers and never fails to give pleasure to those who visitit.
 [38.2] Let us not speak of its beauty, but tell of the King: When the heat of the sun had cooled he set out over the high fields; The grass there was pleasant, thick, clean-cut, fresh and green. Broad as a small sea - its ravines looked like rollingwaves.
 [38.3] The King was enjoying himself, even so his carriage went on. And reaching Singhasari, he had already entered his quarters. But the poet called in on the Buddhist sage. The Abbot of the foundation, also of a family who are to be approached withprofit.
 [38.4] He was already aged more than a thousand months. Loyal, virtuous, of good family, a royal kinsman, pure and of good repute; He was fully accomplished in rites, would not... (?) courtly manners. And was famed as an excellent ecclesiastic whose diligence is to beimitated.
 [38.5] He eagerly received his ardent admirer and promptly welcomed him: Ah young man, welcome is the poet who does his best to wait upon the King, Who can be asked for help, and will show pity on kinsmen who are badly off — My dear fellow, it is like a dream! How can I be of service toyou?'
 [38.6]% My dear, your coming is as though in a dream. May you be received as honored guest.
 [38.7] My aim in coming to you is a wish to ask you about the sequence of the ancestors Of the King who have been enshrined and to whom he is constantly paying honour. Especially the Lord of Kagənəngan - speak of him first. Relate the ancient tale of him, as Son of the Lord of the Mountain.'
  canto 39: 
 [39.1] Indeed the reverend spiritual lord of Mungguh said: 'Oh how wonderful your question is. Poet, it moves me deeply. Of great energy indeed are the poets of mature mind — It is the nature of learning that it win praise amongmen.
 [39.2] Well, give me leave to tell you straight away. Let me wash with waters of the seven holy springs in my mind: "Hail to Girīndra" is my reverence to the deity! Let it not cause any untoward result when I nowspeak.
 [39.3] You should be indulgent, Prince of Poets, when you hear me. As tradition may contain much that is false. But let us hold fast to those who are wise then; Perhaps something is lacking, or possibly there is too much - do not blame me for it!
  canto 40: 
 [40.1] Formerly in the Saka-year "oceans-directions-moon" (1104, AD 1182) there was a great king, of unparalleled valour in battle. Visibly a divine incarnation, known as a son not born from the womb to the illustrious Lord of the Mountain. In fear and reverence all the people paid homage at his feet, respectful and submissive; The illustrious Ranggah Rājasa was his name, victorious over his enemies and a very skilfulwarrior.
 [40.2] A large district to the east of Mount Kawi, full of all kinds of foodstuffs and very lovely. Its status a kuwu, being the residence of a mantri, called Kuṭa Rāja, its people subdued in great numbers. That is where the illustrious son of Girīndra exercised his duties and devoted himself to valour; He devoted himself to pleasing the good and to annihilating evildoers, so that the world might be stable and reverehim.
 [40.3] In the Saka-year "oceans-dice-Sangkaras" (1144, AD 1222) he marched against the king of Kaḍiri, The immaculate hero, the illustrious Kr̥tajaya, learned in the scriptures and teachings on reality. He was swiftly defeated and in great peril he sought to flee by hiding in the hermitage of Pārśwaśūnya; All his servants, especially the soldiers he had left behind in the city, were wipedout.
 [40.4] At the defeat of the king of Kaḍiri all the people of Java were seized with fear and were awe-struck; They came to make an obeisance, bearing all the various products of their regions by way of homage. Janggala and Kaḍiri were one, both united under one ruler, and so very tranquil; That was when the dapur, kuwu and juru were first introduced among the sāmya, to the delight of theworld.
 [40.5] The might and power of the illustrious son of Girindra grew and increased more and more. And the stability of the land of Java was undisturbed, serving at his feet as protector of the world. In the Śaka-year "mouths-oceans-Rudras" (1149, AD 1227) he was duly laid to rest, having returned to heaven; He is known as the one enshrined in a double temple at Kagenəngan, a Śaiwa and a Buddhist, in olden times.
  canto 41: 
 [41.1] Lord Anuṣanātha, son to the Lord, succeeded him as supreme ruler. And while he held power the whole of Java continued to be devoted and attentive. In the Saka-year ''sectmark-mountains-Śambhus" (1170, AD 1248) he was laid to rest and returned to the abode of Girīndra; He was depicted in a splendid image of Śiwa in the foundation atKiḍal.
 [41.2] Lord (Hari) Wiṣṇuwardhana was his son, who succeeded him on the throne. And Lord Narasingha was his colleague; like Mādhawa with his elder brother they gave the world stability: They did away with a villain named Linggapati, so that he and all his men died; All the enemies were fearful at their feet, for they were in truth the incarnations of gods in visibleform.
 [41.3] In Saka "flavours-mountains-moon-moon" (1176, AD 1254) Lord Wiṣṇu inaugurated his son to rule. And all the sāmya of Kaḍiri and Janggala came forward to offer flower-worship at the court. King Kr̥tanagara was his consecration-name, as is wellknown;
 [41.4]The district of Kuṭa Rāja became more and more splendid, and so became known as the city of Singhasāri.
 [41.5] In the Saka-year "air-nine-earth-earth" (1190, AD 1268) Lord Wiṣṇu returned to heaven, having died. He was enshrined at Waleri as a Śaiwa image, and as a Buddhist one at Jajaghu. Shortly afterwards Lord Narasinghamūrti also returned to heaven. And has recently been enshrined by the Prince of Wengkər as an excellent Śaiwa image inKumitir.
 [41.6] Let us also relate how King Kr̥tanagara removed a vile evil-doer By the name of Cayarāja; he was wiped out in the Śaka–year "arms-cattle-moon-earth" (1192, AD 1270) and died. In "mountains-nine-Bhawas" Saka (1197, AD 1275) the King gave theorder
 [41.7]to move against the land of Malayu; Great indeed was their fear, and through his divine incarnation they were defeated.
  canto 42: 
 [42.1] The Saka-year "Twins-empty-suns" (1202, AD 1280) was the time when the King killed an evil man, Mahiṣa Rangkah; he was exceedingly wicked and the whole city complained about him. In Saka "bodies-sky-suns" (1206, AD 1284) he then sent emissaries to Bali to crush it. And before long its queen was overcome and duly brought as captive before theKing.
 [42.2] Likewise the other regions sought protection at the feet of the King: The whole territories of Pahang and of Malayu bowed humbly before him; The whole of Gurun and of Bakulapura also took refuge before him. Not to mention Suṇḍa and Madura, for the whole of Java was unquestioningly devoted tohim.
 [42.3] Nevertheless the King was not negligent, was free of intoxication, and was more and more energetic in his policy. For he had realized how difficult it is to protect the world in the age of Kali. This is why he held fast to esoteric doctrines and observances, and was firmly committed to the sect of the Buddhists, In order to imitate the kings of old, and to guarantee the continued prosperity of the world.
  canto 43: 
 [43.1] In the words of the scriptures, the Paṇḍawas ruled as kings in the Dwāpāra age; "Cattle–mountains-moon–three" with the Saka-era is the moment when they returned to heaven. After their return the Kali age began, and the world became violent and turbulent - Only the divine being who concentrates on the six supernatural faculties of the Buddha could protect the world asgod-king.
 [43.2] This is the reason why the King was firmly devoted to the Śākhya Lion, And attentively adhering to the Five Commandments he was inaugurated and duly consecrated. The name under which he was consecrated as a Jina, Jñanabajreśwara, is widelyknown.
 [43.3]And the King studied the scriptures on reasoning, analysis and so on till he was completely accomplished.
 [43.4] But as he grew somewhat older he held to all sorts of esoteric rites; Mainly of course it was the Subhūti Tantra the essence of which he guarded and cherished in his heart. He applied himself to worship, yoga and meditation for the stability of the whole world. Not to mention the Gaṇacakra always accompanied by gifts, beloved of hissubjects.
 [43.5] Of all the kings of olden times there was none as famous as this king: He had mastered completely the sixfold strategy against enemies, was learned in the scriptures and expert in the works containing teaching on reality; He was very virtuous, firm in his Buddhist observances and very energetic in the rites for application of magic; Hence his descendants have one by one been supreme rulers andgod-kings.
 [43.6] In Śaka "oceans–man-suns" (1214, AD 1292), the King returned to the abode of the lord of the Jinas, Through his knowledge of various rites and all kinds of excellent teachings; As "He who is released in the realms of Śiwa and Buddha" His Majesty was laid to rest, people say; Here is the place where he is enshrined as a Śiwa–Buddha statue of imposingfineness.
 [43.7] And at Sagala he has been set up as a Jina statue of the utmost splendour. Furthermore as an ardhanareśwarī together with Srī Bajradewī, His companion in the increase of the world, one in rites and observances - The divinities Wairocana and Locanā are their image in one statue, which is famous among the people.
 canto 44: 
 [44.1] When King Kr̥tanagara returned to the abode of the Buddha, The world was fearful, sad and tumultuous, as if it would revert to its condition in the Age of Kali. There was a vassal king, a villain known by the name of Jayakatwang, Who there in the land of Kadiri desired to replace him and was outstandingly clever at layingschemes.
 [44.2] When formerly Śrī Kr̥tajaya went forth in Śaka "oceans-Manus-one" (1144, AD 1222), The Son of the Lord of the Mountain ordered that Jayasabha should be the one to replace him as ruler. In Śaka 'eight-one-one', (1180, AD 1258) Śāstrajaya in turn took his place in the land of Kaḍiri, And in Śaka "three–nine–Śangkaras" (1193, AD 1271) King Jayakatwang finally becameking.
 [44.3] Each of the kings had been devoted to the descendants of the Son of the Lord of the Mountains Especially to King Kr̥tanagara - even the other islands obeyed him. Now, however, when the King passed away. King Jayakatwang became blind and strayed from the path; Due to the difficulty of protecting the world in the Age of Kali it was evident that its welfare could not belong-lasting.
 [44.4] Through the influence of his knowledge of the scriptures and the force of the King's efforts before. It came about that there was a son of His Majesty's who defeated the enemy and restored the world. His relationship was son-in-law, and Dyah Wijaya was the title by which people praised him -- Jointly with the Tatars he attacked King Jayakatwang and wiped him out completely.
  canto 45: 
 [45.1] With the death of King Jayakatwang the world was clear and without disturbance. And so in ''seasons–form–suns'' Śaka (1216, AD 1294) the Narārya became king. He ruled in the palace at Majapahit, kindly disposed and victorious over hisenemies.
 [45.2]With the title of His Majesty King Kr̥tarājasa Jayawardhana.
 [45.3] From the moment when King Kr̥tarājasa Jayawardhana began to rule. The whole of Java again became attentive and most humbly came forward to pay respects. Equally delighted to see the King's four consorts. Daughters of King Kr̥tanagara, each comparable to a heavenly woman.
  canto 46: 
 [46.1] The Parameśwarī was named Tribhuwanā, she was the eldest, blameless. With her was Dyah Duhitā, renowned as the Mahādewī and perfect in beauty; Prajñāpāramitā was the name of the one who served as Jayendradewi, of immaculate charm. And the amiable Dyah Gayatri, the youngest, was the foremost as Rājapatnī (King's Consort) in thepalace.
 [46.2] Now this meant of course that he was married to his third cousins, as they were very close relatives. For we know that Lord Wiṣṇu was a first cousin, not a distant relative. Of Śrī Narasinghamūrti, who had as son Dyah Ləmbu Tal the valiant. Who was brave in battle and was enshrined at Mirəng, established in a Buddhist foundation.
  canto 47: 
 [47.1] Dyah Lëmbu Tal had as son the King, And that is why he enjoyed being third cousin to the princesses; That is also how the King's wives were united with him, having one idea in mind: Whatever he ordered was treated as the order of them all, bringing happiness to theworld.
 [47.2] In Śaka ''seven-man-suns" (1217, AD 1295) the King is described: He confirmed his son as ruler of Kaḍintən; Śrī Indreśwarī was his mother, and he was manly, clever and knowledgeable. His royal consecration-name was Jayanāgara, as everyoneknows.
 [47.3] In Saka "moon-three-suns" (1231, AD 1309) the King passed away. Soon he was set up as a Jina-image within the palace -Antahpura is the name of the sanctuary. And as a Śiwa-image he is also at Simping.
  canto 48: 
 [48.1] And then King Jayanāgara was left behind as king of Majapahit, With the princesses, his younger sisters, who were the daughters of the worthy Rājapatnī, the incomparable; They were both of the greatest beauty, like a pair of Ratihs, surpassing the women of heaven – The elder was Princess of Jīwana, and the younger ruled as Princess ofDaha.
 [48.2] In Saka "release-qualities-wings-form" (1238, AD 1316), the month of Madhu, let us tell of King Jayanāgara who set out to remove an enemy in Lamajang: Pu Nambi was broken and all his family at Pajarakan dispersed, their stronghold razed; The world was fearful and awed at the valour of the rulingking.
 [48.3] In Saka '"dot-arrows-suns" (1250, AD 1328) the King returned to Wiṣṇu's abode; Soon he was enshrined within the palace, his statue being the highest image of Wiṣṇu; Also at Śilā Pəṭak and at Bubat he had the same image as an incarnation of Wiṣṇu‚ without compare. And at Sukhalīla the splendid Buddhist image as a visible manifestation of Amoghasiddhi.
  canto 49: 
 [49.1] Verily in the Saka-year "moon-arrows-two-form" (1251, AD 1329) The Princess of Jīwana, known to us as the mother of the King, Succeeded in Majapahit as Queen, And the King's father inSinghasāri.
 [49.2] It was the disposition of the great Rājapatnī, That these should be the auspicious leaders of the world, distinguished from others. Her daughter, son-in-law and grandson being kings and queens. It was she who made them rulers and watched over all theiraffairs.
 [49.3] In Saka "fires-arrows-suns" (1253, AD 1331) the enemies were destroyed: Saḍeng and Kéta were defeated, overcome by her personal retinue; That was the moment when the burden of protecting the world passed To the minister by the name of Mada, a man exceedinglywise.
 [49.4] Further, in the Śaka–year "arrows-seasons-eyes-navel" (1265, AD 1343) The king of Bali was evil and base - He was attacked with an army, broken and completely crushed; Every kind of evildoer was fearful, and made offquickly!
 [49.5] Dang Ācārya Ratnāngśa's words ran thus. What the old man said was true and his speech was deeply moving - The excellence of the King in the world was evident. For he is of divine descent, as well as the incarnation of adivinity.
 [49.6] People who hear the tale of the kings, If they are content, their devotion increases; Clearly their evil deeds cease to dominate them. And suffering, disease and so forth are clearlyannihilated.
 [49.7] The reverend cleric said again by way of apology: What I have heard, my dear fellow, ends here. May you find good fortune and increase of scholarship As fruit of uttering the praises of the mightyones!
 [49.8] After he had duly been entertained, with sincere words The poet took leave to go and attend to his duties. Night came and that evening he lodged in the camp; Soon it was morning and he went to pay his respects before theKing.
 
chapter 6: 
 canto 50: 
 [50.1] Let us describe how the King went to roam in the hunting-preserve: He set out with weapons, with servants, chariots and horses. There in the Nandaka forest, a wood very hard to penetrate, Its trees most terrifying, and the kāśa and muñja grass spreadingfar.
 [50.2] The troops circled round in great numbers till they filled the place. And chariots stood side by side in close order. The wood was encircled, the monkeys were startled and took fright. And the birds were in commotion, bent on getting away in theiragitation.
 [50.3] The din of the servants echoed back and forth as they lit fires everywhere. It resounded like the thunderous roar of the sea. The flames of the fires blazed as high as the sky. Like the Khaṇḍava wood once burnt by the godAgni.
 [50.4] Watch the animals fleeing in blind panic! Bewildered they ran back and forth in bands trying to be first. For when they tried to run away they found fearful things on all sides and hesitated. Hence they withdrew and sought the safety of the centre, gatheringthere.
 [50.5] Their numbers were like wild bulls in a corral, incalculable. Like cattle in a 'bull-city', filling it with their vast numbers: Pigs, barking-deer, wild bulls, buffaloes, porcupines, chevrotains. Iguanas, monkeys, wild cats, rhinoceroses and soon.
 [50.6] When all the animals who lived in the wood had reached that place. They were all in agreement with each other – there was no quarrel. It was as if they were conferring, with the King of the Beasts as their chairman; At his side the jackal camc forward without hesitation. 
 canto 51: 
 [51.1] 'Forgive my question to you. Lord of the Beasts, But seeing that the King is combing the depths of the woods, come, what policy should we adopt? Just to wait and die where we stand, or should we flee? Or again, should we offer resistance, like the crab that does not retreat whenattacked?'
 [51.2] Of such a kind were the words of the jackal before the king; The deer, black antelope, ruru (species of antelope) and chevrotain said straight away: As might be expected of us, we have no other plan to follow Than to flee in the hope of finding a place tohide.'
 [51.3] The wild bull, the buffalo, bull and wild dog said: 'Fie! You animals are wrong, really and truly you are low, despicable beasts! It would not be the action of a hero to run away, or either just to wait — To resist is the rule to be adhered to, in order to achieve a happyoutcome.'
 [51.4] The King of the Beasts replied: 'Your words are equally worthy of being taken as a guide. But if you are able to distinguish between a good and a bad man whenever you see one. In the case of a bad man one's course of action is plain, whether it be to run away or to advance. For one is unwilling to let oneself be killed for no usefulpurpose.
 [51.5] Even so, in the case of members of the three sects, Śaivas, Buddhists and Ṛṣis, It would be best simply to run away and to go along with them, being scholars. But if you happen to be found by the King while he is out hunting, You should merely await death and offer him your life withouthesitating.
 [51.6] For the King is a proper person for created beings to give up their lives for – Lord Giripati is incarnated in him as a mighty ruler. It is clear that the sins of one who dies by his hand are taken away, And that is better than the excellent deed of casting oneself into a holylake.
 [51.7] Who will be my enemy in this world if everyone torments us equally? However, I have an aversion to the Three Sects, and promptly keep my distance. Furthermore if I should meet the King I shall certainly offer him my life. And shall not be born again as an animal, as a result of being killed by him.'
 canto 52: 
 [52.1] It was as if they had been talking thus in a meeting. And finally they stood there together paying their respects. Armed troops and foot-soldiers rushed forward hunting. But met by the horned animals they turned tail andfled.
 [52.2] Let us tell about those in charge of the horses, out hunting together: They headed for the wild pigs which had just gathered; The sows were pitiful when several were killed. Overpowered together with their helplessyoung.
 [52.3] The boars now made ready to advance. Four or five at a time – formidable, big and tall. Their mouths were foaming, they were red in the eyes. And their tusks were terrible, just likedaggers.
 [52.4] The attacking hounds they finished off and killed – The ribs of some were snapped, or their necks were severed. They tried to overpower them once again, and they inflicted losses on each other while they grappled – Their clash was like a battle, fierce and confused.
  canto 53: 
 [53.1] Let us tell of the hunters pursuing the gazelles and deer, shouting to each other: One was being urged forward, grappled with a hook; exhausted and weak It went, hit in the thigh, its blood flowing thick and fast. And another, painfully struck in the leg with a kick, fell wounded to theground.
 [53.2] The troops recovered themselves and noisily with their spears they dashed after them; The small game lay in heaps, not to mention the deer, their losses piled up. The horned animals returned to the fray, the wild bulls leading the furious beasts – The King's troops broke ranks and fled in fright, with losses under the fierceattack.
 [53.3] Some took refuge in overgrown ravines, or hid behind bigtrees.
 [53.4]And others clambered onto branches, competing to get higher and dangling there.
 [53.5]Unlucky the ones who took refuge in trees – when they came climbing down again
 [53.6]Their calves were attacked at close quarters and gored, they were taken by surprise and struggled to get free.
 [53.7] Instantly several officials with their mounts vyed to make a comeback. Wielding lances and pikes, stabbing, throving javelins, hurling things and kicking. This is why the horned animals fled in a thundrous stampede. followed, chased and pursued – their losses lay spread roundabout, shattered andoverpowered.
 [53.8] Of the King's priests, Śaiva and Buddhist, some joined in the hunt, bearing spears; Snarled at by a wild dog they turned to run, and when he went after them they took off as fast as they could go. Apparently they had neglected their rituals, or they were not virtuous. Joining in the concern for worldly things, and thereby forgetting that they already been granted a special favour.
  canto 54: 
 [54.1] Let us relate how His Majesty had mounted his immaculate carriage. Shining and exceedingly high; the fearless bulls that drew it were well trained. He headed for the midst of the woods and pursued every kind of frightening animal, And this is why the other army withdrew and broke, abandoning the dead bodies andfleeing.
 [54.2] Left behind, the boars, black antelope, ruru, chevrotain and so on were overcome with fear; The King advanced mounted on a horse to follow them as they ran off in tumult. Officials, officers and scholars, all those on the horses, joined in the hunt. And the animals were overcome – stabbed, speared, finished off and krissed, they died without agasp.
 [54.3] The ground there is very wide and level, and the woods are thick but below it is open. So that the deer were completely helpless, pursued as fast as the horses couldgo.
 [54.4]The King was pleased when he stopped to rest and take refreshments; the officials and scholars came before him And told him all they had done to get what they had bagged, which made him laugh.
 
chapter 7: 
 canto 55: 
 [55.1] Let us leave untold how the King while hunting enjoyed himself among the beauties of woods and mountains; Sometimes he would return to the camp to take charge of the royal ladies again Like someone on a pleasure-trip, and sometimes it was like conquering the kingdom of an enemy – Aware of the sins of the animals he was not indulging an evil passion but adhering to the duty ofnon-violence.
 [55.2] Let us relate how he made ready to return home, for he was missing the attractions of his capital: So duly at a favourable moment he set out, going by way of Bañu Hangət, Banir and Talijungan; He spent the night at Wəḍva-vədvan, and the next day passed through Kūvarāha and Cëlong, As well as Dadamar, Garantang, Pager Talaga and Pahañangan – this is where he headedfor.
 [55.3] The following day he passed straight through Tambak, Rabut Wayuha and Balanak, Aiming for Paṇḍakan and Bhanarāgi, to spend the night on arrival atPadāmayan.
 [55.4]Turning back south-westwards he went to Jajava at the foot of the holy mountain Kumukus, 
 [55.5]And came before the lord of the sanctuary with flower-offerings and drums – people were delighted to see it.
  canto 56: 
 [56.1] Now the character of the foundation in the past is of course well-known: It was a pious work of King Kṛtanagara, the great-grandfather of the King. Moreover it was he who ruled over it in bodily form, and he alone. And hence it was both Śaivas and Buddhists who always used to worshipthere.
  [56.2] As a sign of this the caṇḍi below was Śaiva, with a Buddhist pinnacle above. And with in was a splendid image of Śiva of limitlessfineness;
 [56.3]A statuette of Akṣobhya above the crown was undoubtedly its highest point.
 [56.4]And it was through its supernatural powers that it was destroyed, being truly of the highest essence of Void.
  canto 57: 
 [57.1] He was travelling about visiting holy bathing-places and chose to spend the night within the sanctuary. He humbly came before the holy statue and with great devotion he respectfully offered praises. This caused the Abbot to feel pained, as hedoubted
 [57.2]Whether he was entitled to worship an image of Śiva, and so he asked about it with an apology.
 [57.3] The sage informed him of the true nature of the sanctuary in thepast.
 [57.4]And of the presence of the holy statue of Akṣobhya, very hard to make out there above.
 [57.5]When on his way back he again spent the night in the sanctuary in the presence.
 [57.6]He was disappointed and dismayed to see that the statue had completely vanished.
 [57.7] It must have been in 'fires-arrows-suns' of the Saka-era (1253, AD 1331) that the holy statue disappeared; When it disappeared the fine caṇḍi within was struck by lightning. The repeated account of the great monk is clear and leaves no room for doubt – It could not possibly become a sanctuary again, and moreover had already beendeserted.
 [57.8] Its layout is indescribably beautiful, like heaven come down to earth: Its gateway outside, the surrounding wall, and the pavilions and other buildings are all excellent;
 [57.9]Inside it is adorned with thick nāgapuspa flowers in bloom. Which the palace ladies excitedly use to bedeck their hair.
 [57.10] For some time the King happily wandered there in search of natural beauty:
 [57.11]At Wulu Dada the pool was extraordinary, its ferns spreading out below the water -
 [57.12]He made for here by going east from the sanctuary whenever the sun was hot.
 [57.13]And also went to Pakalvangan through the ravine, indulging his wishes to the full.
  canto 58: 
 [58.1] Let us relate how, when he departed from Jajava, he went in the direction of Paḍamcyan, Halting at Cunggrang to enjoy the scenery while wandering in the woods entranced by their charm. It was a Ṛṣi sanctuary on the slope of Mount Pavitra that he went to. And recorded the beauties of the valleys seen below in the form of bhāsa andkidung.
 [58.2] When he had finished amusing himself there, in the morning the carriages were standing ready, having been put in order. He set off westwards at the foot of the mountain, travelling over the roads he had followed before. Reaching Japan where he put up for the night, the King was met by the troops coming out to fetch him – Those left behind in the palace were longing for this audience when they would joyfully come into hispresence.
 [58.3] The third hour was the time for the princes to take a meal, having gathered there, Led by the King's father and uncle both seated in proper order at the head;
 [58.4]The princes of Matahun and Paguhan were by the King's side, close by. 
 [58.5]Each with his wife; how long they took over their meal need not be told.
  canto 59: 
 [59.1] The King set out next morning riding in a carriage, continuing on his way;
 [59.2]The poet took the turn-off for Rabut Tugu with some attendants.
 [59.3]Calling in at Pahyangan he met members of his family who had gathered there;
 [59.4]They entertained him, apologizing that they were too unimportant for him to visit.
 [59.5] The King passed through Banasara and SangkanAdoh,
 [59.6]And when he arrived on the outskirts of the city it was already about the second hour.
 [59.7]All the roads he passed along were crowded with elephants, horses and carts lined up.
 [59.8]Not to mention the draught-buffaloes with their leaders, a great crowd.
 [59.9] As if specially arranged the princes proceeded, duly accompanying each other: The Princess of Pajang with her husband and all their servants went in front;
 [59.10]The Princess of Lasëm at their rear was likewise, not far behind –
 [59.11]Their carriages were splendid and delighted the onlookers.
 [59.12] The Princess of Daha and the Prince of Wéngkër were behindthem,
 [59.13]And the Princess of Jīvana behind them, with her husband and servants following on.
 [59.14]The procession was completed by the King's countless carriages in contingents
 [59.15]With some thousands of armed officers escorting them.
 [59.16] Let us speak of the people in the streets, lining the roads row on row. Crowded in the shade awaiting the moment When the King Would pass. Excitedly the women came out to the gates, noisily pushing for a place. And there were some whose breast-cloth came off, they ran soimpetuously.
 [59.17] Those whose houses were further off jostled for places in talltrees.
 [59.18]And maidens young and old hung dangling in bunches from the branches.
 [59.19]There were coconut-palms and sugar-palms there – these they climbed without reflecting.
 [59.20]Simply forgetting they could be seen – all they thought of was getting a view!
 [59.21] When the King arrived the kala and conches rang out in chorus. And all the people in the streets bowed low in fear and awe. When he had passed there was the tumult of those escorting him at the rear–
 [59.22]Elephants, horses, donkeys, camels and carts rolled ceaselessly onwards. 
 canto 60: 
 [60.1] On foot went the serried ranks of foot-soldiers. The countless carriers coming on behind – Pepper, safflower, cotton, coconuts,betel-nuts,
 [60.2]Kalayar and tamarind they earned, as well as sesame-seeds.
 [60.3] Behind these came ones carrying heavy burdens. Puffing and going with difficulty, loaded down and leading
 [60.4]Puppies on the right and piglets on the left.
 [60.5]Fowls and ducks in baskets, hampered and bent low.
 [60.6] One carrier was trying to carry all kinds ofwares:
 [60.7]Catechu, thorn-apple, bamboo-shoots, palm-spathes, young tamarind.
 [60.8]Winnows, steamers, cooking-pots, trays and fire-drills -
 [60.9]It looked as if it would all clatter to the ground, so that he got laughed at.
  [60.10] Let us describe how the princes arrived together at the palace, And had returned to their residences each one. Recalling all they had done before, And devoting themselves to whatever would please their ownpeople.
 
chapter 8: 
 canto 61: 
 [61.1] Time went by, and when the King had been some time in thecapital,
 [61.2]The month of Bhadra in Śaka 'two-elephants-suns' (1282, AD 1360) arrived. Then the King went to Tirib and to Sëmpur; The game was plentiful in the woods there, and when he attacked them their losses were many.
 [61.3]our translation: Time went by, and when the King had been some time in the capital (rājya?), The month of Bhadra in Śaka 'two-elephants-suns' (1282, AD 1360) arrived. Then the King went to Tirib and to Səmpur; The game was plentiful in the woods, when he attacked them their losses were many.
 [61.4] About the toponyms Tirib and Sempur, Pigeaud comments: “As Tirib is the name of a village in the modem district of Wånågiri, south of Surakarta, in Central Java, it seems a likely supposition that the Royal Chase of 1360 was held in that far-off hilly region bordering on the Southern Ocean. King Hayam Wuruk had a predilection for the seashore, and his last visit to the western districts (Pajang) was seven years ago. Tirip (ending in a p) figures in the triad Pangkur, Tawan, Tirip, mentioned in several old Royal charters of Central Javanese origin, but even in the Majapahit period not wholly forgotten. The names are supposed to belong originally to an ancient triad (sang māna katriṇi [possibly to be read: mānak katriṇi]) of rural community officials in the time of an extinct 10th century Central Javanese dynasty (v. comm. on Ferry Charter plate V). The identification of Näg. Tirib with old Tirip seems too hazardous. A village of the name of Sempu is known in the modern district of Pacitan, which borders on Wänägiri. Sempon is the name of two villages in the district of Wånågiri itself. As sempu or sempur is the name of a tree (Dillenia) it is not to be wondered at that it was used as a village- or a district-name. As far as is known the district of Wanägiri has no remains of important buildings dating from Majapahit times or before. That is in accordance with the fact that the King did not visit any shrine in Sömpur and Tirib; only the hunt is mentioned.
 [61.5] In Saka 'three-bodies-suns' (1283) in the month of Vaiśāka, the King went to worship at Palah with his followers. At great length he visited every beautiful spot to enjoy himself: Lwang Wéntar, Manguri, Balitar andJimbe.
 [61.6] Without a care he went southwards from Balitar along the road. It was a steep slope, and the trees were sparse and withered, far from water. Arriving in Loḍaya, he stayed there some nights, and abandoning himself to the charms of the sea he went walking along theshore.
 [61.7] Having departed from Loḍaya, he remained at Simping, desiring to use the opportunity to restore the holy sanctuary. The dilapidation of the tower-temple, as well as its distance to the west. Such was the reason why it should be rebuilt a little further to the east.
 canto 62: 
 [62.1] Also the dimensions had not yet been checked against thecharter.
 [62.2]And so they vere measured right around in fathoms, beginning vith the east and indicated vith markers. But as the monastery of Gurung-gurung vas taken as land for the sanctuary, Gontong and Wiṣṇu Rare vould be a Bajradhara domain as His Majesty's compensation.
  [62.3] On his return the King went via Jukung Jo and Yānabajra, going eastwards; Reaching Bajralakṣmi he stopped there to rest and spent the night at the foundation at Sūrabhāṇa. Setting out next morning he made a stop at Bəkəl and late in the afternoon arrived at the capital; All those accompanying him had also returned, each one to his ownhome.
 
chapter 9: 
 canto 63: 
 [63.1] Let us describe the princes in the morning: they came out in a group to give audience to the dependent ministers. The Āryas being the foremost of those in the presence, as well as the Patihs seated in order in the covered pavilion. Then the Prime Minister, the valiant Gajah Mada, came before them and while bowing said respectfully that: “There is a royal ceremony to be discussed, [and] the Āryas should not neglectit.
  [63.2] “Listen to the order of Her Majesty Queen Tribhuwanā Wijayottunggadewī, that the obsequies for the Rājapatnī should be completed and that this is to be carried out by the princes in the palace. The ritual should be accomplished in the Śaka-year with as units "colours" in the month of Bhādra. All the princes will contribute food [offerings] and they will be attended by the seniorministers.”
  [63.3] Thus spoke the eminent minister, to general agreement and causingthe
 [63.4]princes to be pleased; That afternoon there arrived the Ḍapurs, Aputih and Sujyana being the most knowledgeable of them. And the officials -- whoever had been given fields would be responsible, with Āyra Rāmādhirāja at their head; It was the level of the costs that they tried to estimate and discussed before the princes.
  [63.5] Let us pass this over and tell how Bhadrapada had almost come and nowon
 [63.6]the last day of Śrāwana All the craftsmen doubled their efforts erecting a lion-throne in the outer courtyard. Others were preparing trays for food, processional shrines and floats with all their accessories. Joined by the ḍaḍap-makers, gold and silversmiths who were busily occupied increasing their production.
   canto 64: 
 [64.1] When the auspicious time arrived the immaculate court had already been set up: There in the centre the splendid halls were adorned like highprisadi;
 [64.2]There was a group with a platform of stone, with fine red-painted pillars and a decorated ridge-pole – 
 [64.3]They were radiant, as they were located in front of the awesome lion-throne.
 [64.4] On the west a mandapa with hangings was erected as a place for the gathered princes. And on the north were the neatly constructed awnings going round to the east and rising in terraces at the rear; The wives of the officials, scholars and priests were the ones who would have their couches there – it was already full up. And in the south the hosts of servants – their countless awnings extended inrows.
 [64.5] Now the procedure for the royal ceremony was the ultimate in worship of the All-Knowing Buddha: All the Buddhist priests adept in the Tantras were witnesses to the drawing of the sacred circle. Led by the Abbot, the chief court-chaplain who is diligent in the foundation at Naḍī, A man of established piety, very virtuous, righteous and completely imbued with the teachings of the ThreeTantras.
 [64.6] Because of his age, a thousand months of his earthly existence having been devoted to religious studies. He suffered from physical disabilities – not to mention the many good disciples who attended him. So the spiritual lord of Paniha in fact acted as 'right-hand man' for his role in the sacred circle. And hand-gestures, sacred formulas and muttered prayers in keeping with the correct pronunciation were manipulated to focus themind.
 [64.7] On the twelfth the soul was invoked and the recitation of the Sutras was attended to. And sacrifices, worship and other efforts were completed for the coming of the soul again. The holy flower was brought to life by means of yoga and that night the Supratiṣṭha ritual was performed. The essence of meditation and powerful mental concentration being applied by the great Abbot.
  canto 65: 
 [65.1] The morning of the day of the full moon was the time when it came forthto
 [65.2]receive homage in the midst of the court. Loud trumpets, conches and gañjaran drums in front escorting it in countless numbers. On the splendid throne, high and mysterious, that was the place where it was paid homage. And when all the Buddhists, young and old, had gathered they uttered praises in due order.
 [65.3] Then the princes came together into the presence to offer flower-worship, humbly with wives and children. Joined by the Prime Minister Gajah Mada as the most eminent of those who came forward with their wives to pay their respects. As well as the officials stationed in the Outer Regions and kings of all the other countries; When they had finished devotedly paying their respects, their seats were arranged according torank.
 [65.4] The Prince of Paguhan was the first to present his perfect food. And Śrī Handiwa-handiwa was the form of his float which bore dukūla cloth andbetel-leaf
 [65.5]As for the Prince of Matahun, his float was a white bull and also resembled Nandinī;
 [65.6]This produced money and food from its mouth in a remarkable way without ceasing.
 [65.7] As for the Prince of Wəngkər, his excellent food was neatly arranged and carried in a single-pillared pavilion; Its arrangement was amazing in every respect and of great value, accompanied by the bestowal of money equally among the court. The Prince of Tumapël's float was also unusual and charming, with the bodies of loving women; Each one had a day of his own for expressing a variety ofideas.
 [65.8] The main one was His Majesty's: an extraordinary Mount Mandara was his carrier for the wonderful food. At the time when it was being turned, models of the host of gods and demons circling around it – those who saw it were awed. Carp of an exceedingly large size filled a fish-pond, swimming around together. As if ill and drunken because of the sea-water, increasing the bustle of thecourt.
 [65.9] Thus every day all kinds of floats, whatever was superior and excellent, were intended as offerings to the deity; The wives of officials, assessors and priests received a share of what was left of them, just the right amount each one; Also the nobles, the leading relatives of the King, were bestowed with gifts as appropriate. Not to mention the choice foods that were passed around among all the King's troops in thecourt.
 canto 66: 
 [66.1] On the morning, then, of the sixth day, Bhaṭāra Narapati duly came into the presence with food. As well as the most eminent of the nobles: their pavilions and processional shrines filled the place, carried in row on row. The two Superintendents had as carriers ships, each depicting a scene from the ballads. And as big as real ships; gongs large and small resounded back and forth to escort them, deeply impressing theonlookers.
 [66.2] The Prime Minister, Gajah Mada, on the same day made an offering in the presence: His fine float was of grieving women in the shade of a nāgasari tree, rājasa blooms vying to entwine it. The officials and Āryas in charge of the districts followed on with the village heads and joined them in making offerings; Many were the shapes of their carriers for food: some were boats, mountains, pavilions or fish – they kept oncoming.
 [66.3] The good taste of the princes' celebration was most wonderful, the very ultimate in excellence. For on the seventh day the money, clothing with limitless food did not stop. They were distributed to the Four Estates, primarily the priests followed by the countless officials, who were pleased. And in their enthusiasm the juru and sāmya started clapping their hands because the drinks were flowing like atorrent(?).
 [66.4] Crowds of onlookers from all directions milled noisily without a gap; The appearance of the court and those offering food, these they watched, pushing for a place. The Queen danced in the hall, and it was only ladies who looked on in her presence. All seated in serried rows, tightly packed – some forgot themselves as they looked on in speechlesswonder.
 [66.5] Every performance that might please the people the King held: See the storytellers and masked dancers taking turns with all kinds of singers every day! Not to mention the warriors shouting challenges – naturally the ones as loud as thunderclaps gave people a fright and made them laugh. And in particular the constant donations to every kind of person begging alms caused everyone to be joyful.
 canto 67: 
 [67.1] As the princes performed the obsequies to care for the departed in this way.
 [67.2]So they could not fail to bring about the happiness of the Rājapatnī for whom they were carried out. May it move her to bestow prosperity on the King's reign: May King Rajasanāgara be victorious over enemies, as long as there are a sun and moon!
 [67.3] In the morning the Buddhists came to worship and to send off the one they worshipped; She became Prajñāparimitā, returning to the realm of the great Buddha. The holy flower-body was promptly cast upon the waters, and when it had completely disappeared, All the offerings to the demons too were divided up and shared out among the throng ofservants.
 [67.4] The princes felt relieved and serene when the celebration was over, nothing disturbed their thoughts – They strove only to have her sanctuary at Kamal Pandak completed;
 [67.5]Moreover the ground had already been consecrated in Śaka 'fires-seven-suns'(1273, AD 1351); It was Śrī Jñānavidhi who performed it and who had then made a brahmayajña as his act of worship.
  canto 68: 
 [68.1] And so this is the tale of the tamarind-tree, known through a reliabletradition:
 [68.2]Formerly, in Śāka 'ages-mountains-Nanda' (974, AD 1052), the reign of King Janggala of Jīvana, And King Pañjalu of Daha was the time when the land of Java was divided into two –
 [68.3]King Airlangghya brought it about out of love for his sons, the two kings.
  [68.4]And so this is the tale of the tamarind-tree, known through a reliable tradition: Formerly, in Śāka 'ages-mountains-Nanda' (974, AD 1052), the reign of the ruler of Janggala in Jīvana and the ruler of Pañjalu in Daha, was the time when the land of Java was divided into two – King Airlaṅga brought it about out of love as he had the two kings as children.
 [68.5]Robson was off the mark here. The text means to say that Jīvana and Daha are the names of the respective capitals/kratons. In the Deśavarṇana context, the equivalence Jīvana = Kahuripan can be confirmed by comparing 1.4b and 2.2d. The distinction between “palace” (nagara) and “land” (bhūmi) is clearly reflected in the wording of the Mula Malurung charter, which differentiates nagara daha from bhūmi kaḍiri (7r4).
 [68.6] There was a Buddhist of the Mahāyana school, a master of the Tantras and a lord of yogis. Who dwelt in the midst of the cemetery at Lemah Citra, sought out bypeople.
 [68.7]And who reached Bali over the water, treading the waters of the sea without danger. Called the holy Mpu Bharaḍa, firm in his knowledge of the past and so on and the three ages.
  [68.8] This holy man was requested to divide the land, and was not unwilling. And so he marked the boundary of this with water in a pot from the sky. From west to east up to the sea, north and south were divided from each other – But as far as if separated by an ocean – and from then on Java had twokings.
 [68.9]And over there is the village of Palungan, the place where he put down the water-pot, as everyone knows. He was stopped by the height of the tamarind-tree, he caught his robe in its crown. And that is why he cursed it to become small, and also why it is on the dividing-line.
  [68.10] Its function was to be a marker, the origin of people being scared to leave their own homes. And so a sanctuary was built, so that the land of Java should be one again. Should be stable with a king of the whole country, and so that the people might know it in future without having any doubts. And to be a sign that the King is victorious over the whole world as a sovereign ruler.
 canto 69: 
 [69.1] Prajñāparimitāpurî is the name by which the holy sanctuary is generally known, And a Prajñāparimitā-ritual was performed by Śrī Jñānavidhi to establish it. As is to be expected of a senior scholar, versed in the Tantras, who has succeeded in acquiring a knowledge of all holy scriptures. Evidently the holy Mpu Bharaḍa was embodied in him, and this caused the King to bepleased.
 [69.2] And now Bhayalangə̄ is also a place where the Rājapatnī has beenenshrined;
 [69.3]The revered Jñānavidhi was sent out once again to perform the worship and to consecrate the ground to establish it. The reason for calling it Wiśeṣapura is that efforts were made to devote special attention to setting it up; The high official Who received instructions to supervise it was Dëmung Bhoja, who is young, energetic and discerning.
 [69.4] The locations for worshipping her are spread far and wide, set up as memorial shrines in every district. Whether it be a veśapuri or a pakuvvan it is a place of worship of the great Rājapatnī. Every month of Bhadra she is worshipped by the Amātyas and the Brahmas, all of whom are devoted to her. And she tastes pleasure in her heaven, having as grandson one distinguished as sole sovereign of the land ofJava.
 
chapter 10: 
 canto 70: 
 [70.1] In the Śaka-year 'winds-eight-suns' (1285, AD 1363) it is related that the King Went travelling to Simping, where the holy sanctuary was to be moved. With the prescribed rites and ceremonies and no lack of any kind of proper offering. The famous superintendent Ārya Rājaparākrama performed theworship.
  [70.2] He was expert in the rites and teachings of Śaivism, So it was he who gave King Kr̥tarajasa a visible form there. The tower-temple, gateway and surrounding wall were being moved at that moment. So the well-known Ārya named Krung was permitted to exercise carefulsupervision.
  [70.3] When the King returned from Simping, he went straight into the palace. As he was concerned at the illness of the minister of ministers, Gajah Mada. The latter had been his companion in bringing about an increase in Java's power in the past: In Bali and in Saḍeng was the proof of his success in wiping out enemies.
 [70.4]When the King returned from Simping, he came straight to the palace, concerned by the illness of the chief minister, Gajah Mada. He had been his companion in the expansion of the land of Java in the past. Bali and Saḍeng are the proof of his achievement in wiping out enemies. 
 
chapter 11: 
 canto 71: 
 [71.1] Saka 'three-winds-suns' (1253, AD 1331) was the first time that he tookupon
 [71.2]himself the burden of supporting the whole world. And when he died in the Saka-year 'tastes-bodies-suns' (1286, AD 1364) the princes were downhearted, dejected and despairing. Truly in his sublimity of spirit he was without attachment and kindly disposed to the whole world; Mindful of the transient nature of existence, it was only good works to which he devoted himself daily.
 [71.3] Now at the deliberations of the princes the King's father and uncle Were both gathered. And the King's mother and aunt Were With them, as Well as his two younger sisters, followed by their husbands. They discussed who might be able to judge the virtues and vices of the troops in order to replace the Prime Minister; They debated it at length, but could not yet find a satisfactory solution, and this caused a painful difference ofopinion.
 [71.4] The princes drew the conclusion that the Prime Minister could not bereplaced.
 [71.5]In the absence of a possible replacement; even if it were a problem for people, this would be disregarded. Only those Amātya wise enough always to inform the princes on any subject should be chosen. And be put at the head of those who discuss ways and means and who might take charge of disputes without referring to established authority.
  canto 72: 
 [72.1] This was the extent of their private consultations; The decision resulting from their discriminating judgement was To select as Senior Minister Ārya Ātmarāja, surnamed PuTaṇḍi,
 [72.2] Together with the colleague of the princes, Ārya Vīramaṇḍalika, surnamed Pu Nāla, Knowledgeable in the benefit and punishment of good and evildoers, A governor with the title ofTumənggung,
 [72.3] Of a line possessing superior qualities, valiant and true. Always in command of troops in the field. See the other countries, namely Dompo, Crushed by him, inflicting numerous losses on theenemy,
 [72.4] The actual nature of these eminent ministers is dual. Their function is to be the 'hands and feet' of the King, just that; They would report all complicated matters relating to legal proceedings. But be assisted by officials andassessors.
 [72.5] Patih Dami vas the Junior Minister - He was always highly regarded within the palace. And the Patih named Pu Singha Would be witness to all that the princesordered.
 [72.6] Such being the arrangement ordained by the princes, The world was content and permanently stable. Its loyalty and devotion grew more and more -It was the lordship of the King that caused it to beso.
 
chapter 12: 
 canto 73: 
 [73.1] But the King of Majapahit became all the more energetic in the proper conduct of affairs; In legal proceedings he made no discrimination but adhered to the whole essence of the legal texts. There arose no partiality when granting honours which would befit any of the people – It was merit that he strove for, as he knew the future and so on, indeed the incarnation of a god in visible form.
 [73.2] Then as for the royal sanctuaries founded by the King's ancestors in the past, All that he had not yet completed were put in order, guarded and assiduously cared for. Any that lacked a charter was to be provided with one on his instructions by experts in the proper formulas. So that its benefit might be lasting, without giving rise to disputes, and might descend to all his descendants in lateryears.
 [73.3] The number of the royal sanctuaries famed far and wide begins with Kagənəngan, And the leading ones are Tumapəl, Kiḍal, Jajagu, Wəḍva-vəḍvan and Tuban, As well as Pikatan, Bukul‚ Java-java, Antang, Antaraśaśi, Kalang Brat and Jaga, Also Balitar, Śilāhrit, Waleri, Babəg, Kukap, Lumbang and Pagər.

 [74.2] These are the royal sanctuaries, numbering twenty-seven. In the Saka-year 'seven-Brahmans-suns' (1287, AD 1365), the month of Bhādra; It is expert Amātyas who are permitted to watch over them, With abbots and royal priests learned in the scriptures.
 canto 75: 
 [75.1] But the official permitted to be in charge of them all is Ārya Wīrādhikāra, The religious superintendent who watches over every kind of sanctuary of the Interior without neglecting any. With constant effort he strives for the prosperity and welfare of His Majesty; He does not enjoy the benefits of his labours for the high level of revenues of the holysanctuaries.
  [75.2] As for the free sanctuaries on the other hand, the King safeguardstheir
 [75.3]status: The Śaiva superintendent is entrusted with the care of the Parhyangans and the Kalagyans, The Buddhist superintendent is the guardian of all the monasteries and cloisters.

   canto 78: 
 [78.1] The free sanctuaries belonging to Ṛṣis are the ones at Sumpud, Rupit and Pilan, And the ones at Pucangan, Jagaddhita, Pavitra and Butun as well; These all have a pratistha, a sabhā and a linggapranāla in common. And their abbots are commonly given the title 'GreatTeacher'.
 [78.2] These are the free sanctuaries the independence of which was guaranteed in the past. Followed by the freeholds that are without a pratistha; the foremost of them having an unchanging independent status are: Bangvan, Tungkal, Siddhāyatra, Jaya, Siddhâhajə̄ng and Lvah Kali, Tvas, Waśiṣṭha, Palah, Padar and Siringan – the foremost of the ones pertaining to theŚevāngkura.

chapter 13: 
 canto 79: 
 [79.1] The status of all the various districts of Java had already been checkedwhen
 [79.2]they were passed through before: The sanctuaries, freeholds, wangśa, hila-hila, hulun hyang, kuti and kalagyan. All those with a title were confirmed, and whichever were without title to
 [79.3]adhere to. Their servants returned home to their districts having been blamed by Ārya Rāmādhirāja.
 [79.4] The Prince of Wengkər sent out messengers to check on the districts and make a description of them all. And the Prince of Singhasāri sent out messengers to check the size of the 'clusters' and all pertaining to them. They both adhered to the regulations, attending to their work without slacking. And this is why the land of Java is attentive in what it does, in accordance with the King'sprecepts.
 [79.5] Among the outer islands Bali conforms* with all the customs of Java; The status of sanctuaries, hermitages and kuvu has been checked and put in order: The Buddhist Superintendent in Baḍahulu,* Baḍaha and Lvā Gajah is not careless. He supervises all the Buddhist foundations and is sent out by the King to watch overthem.
   canto 80: 
 [80.1] The Buddhist establishments in Bali are the Kādhikaraṇan and Kuṭi Hañar, Pūrvanāgara, Wihāra, Bahung, Ādirājya and Kuturan. Six of these are leading Bajradhara establishments, only Wihāra is a monastery under disciplinary rules (Kavinayan). And the Kuṭis, Ārya Dadi and Rajasanmata being the foremost, are so numerous that they need not bedescribed.
  [80.2] Following these there is the sanctuary at Bukit Sulang Ləmah in Lampung overseas. Known by the name of Tathāgatapura Gr̥hasthādhara, a charter confirming it. 'Sky–tastes–suns' Śaka (1260‚ AD 1338) was the time when the Princess of Jīvana had founded it; it was a senior minister, a Buddhist layman, who consecrated the ground and was then sent out to establishit.
 [80.3] All the independent estates that truly have a legal title have been confirmed by the king. And the pious foundations of the virtuous men of old, in whatever form, are watched over and thus kept safe. Just so is the nature of a most excellent king, distinguished, victorious and mighty – Hence also every pious foundation of his will be guarded by the kings of days tocome.
 [80.4] And this has as aim that evildoers should not be in evidence in any of the countries under his protection. This is why the districts have been checked and traced as far as the ocean and visited. So that the hermits on every shore and hill, in every wood and remote district may be secure, may contentedly attend to their observances, vovs and meditation, and at the same time may bring about the welfare of the world.
 canto 81: 
 [81.1] The King has put great effort into firmly establishing the Three Sects in Java, And it is their ancient customs in old charters that he watches over and cares for. The King's exertions are judicious, his aim in giving them regulations being That they should not be forgetful of the precepts for conduct, of training anddiscipline.
 [81.2] This is the reason why the four categories of clergy each strive to achieve excellence. The Wipra, Ṛṣi, Śaiva and Buddhist are diligent in their ovn kind of learning and attentive; All the Caturāśrama, principally the numerous members of the 'Four Ash-marks', Are submissive to their rules of life and expert at their ownrites.
 [81.3] Now each of the four classes is steadfast in its code of conduct: The Mantris and especially the Aryas are both skilled in the art of government; The nobles of aristocratic birth and the virtuous Walls are watchful in policy. followed by the Weśyas of the whole country, and the Sūdras busily engaged in their ownaffairs.
 [81.4] These are the four classes of men, the high-born who emerge from the divine Order – According to the scriptures any condition of them is entitled by the King (to be admitted) to the palace. These are firmly fixed in their own principles, not to mention the threesorts
 [81.5]of low-born men – The merchants, foreigners and impure, who are equally diligent in their own vays.
 canto 82: 
 [82.1] Such being the condition of the land of Java during His Majesty's reign. He has no doubts in his heart when performing meritorious works to please the people. Moreover the two princes support the King in carrying out the true Law of righteousness. And the King's brothers-in-law, being his junior, are of like mind withhim.
 [82.2] The Prince of Singhasāri has opened up at Sagada an incomparable sanctuary. And the Prince of Wéngkér at Śurabhana, Pasuruhan and the one in Pajang. Those at Rava, Kapulungan and Locanapura are Buddhist seats. And the Prince of Watsari the one at Tigawangi, making the peoplecontent.
 [82.3] All the officials, having obtained a boon, are given freeholds and striveto
 [82.4]outdo each other: It is memorial shrines and tover-temples that they make, as well as linggas
 [82.5]and so on the whole time. Devoted to the gods, devoted to the host of ancestral spirits and equally respectful to the worthy sages. They perform deeds of charity, meritorious acts and good works, following His Majesty's example.
 
chapter : 
 canto 83: 
 [83.1] Such being the excellent qualities of the King, ruling as sovereign over Majapahit, He is praised as being like the moon in autumn, making all the worldcontent.
 [83.2]The evildoers are like day-lotuses and all the good people are like night-lotuses, sincerely loving. And the servants, supplies and vehicles, elephants, horses and so on are as the ocean.
 [83.3] The land of Java has become more and more renowned for its purifying power in the world: It is only India and Java that are noted for their excellence as fine places. Because of the numbers of experts in sacred texts, principally the Superintendents and the Seven Assessors, As well as the Panjang Jīwa, Lekan and Tangar, all who are experienced in affairs, each highlyskilled.
 [83.4] Firstly the Brahmarāja, a worthy priest, a great poet and faultless inhis
 [83.5]knowledge of the scriptures - Every kind of logic he knows, he is expert in the great kāwya, in Nyāya philosophy and so on; And also Ḍang Hyang Bāmana, highly competent in observances, virtuous, a master in the sacred texts and the six pure duties. Not to mention Śrī Wiṣṇu, who is immersed in hymns and prayers that have as aim the increase of the world's abundance.
 [83.6] And so constantly all kinds of people come from other countries incountless
 [83.7]numbers - See: India, Cambodia, China, Annam, Champa, the Carnatic and so on, Gaur and Siam are their places of origin, sailing on ships with the merchants in numbers.
 [83.8]Monks and priests in particular, when they come they are given food and are happy to stay.
 [83.9] Now every Phalguṇa the King is honoured and treated with solicitude in his own palace: There arrive the officials of all Java, the juru and kuwu as well as the Superintendents and all the Assessors, Joined by the Balinese as first among the other islands, all with their gifts in uninterrupted numbers; Vendors and merchants fill the markets and all their various wares are piled up inabundance.
 [83.10] The procedure for the worship is that a procession of portable shrines with drums is escorted by the common people Seven times, each day increasing with one, together with offerings heading for the Outer Courtyard. The homa and brahmayajña are performed by the Śaiwa and Buddhist priests as their worship. Commencing on the 8th of the 'dark' half of the month, and having as fruit the well-being of the King.
 canto 84: 
 [84.1] The 14th having arrived, let us describe how the King comes out: In order to make a tour of the city he dons ornaments of gold and so on. And gleaming brightly he is carried in a palanquin, making his way over carpets laid one after the other; Officials and all the Śaiva bhujangga are the foremost of those wearing the clothing presented to them and accompanying him innumbers.
 [84.2] The drums, tabours and trutika ring out, not to mention the loud conchesand
 [84.3]trumpets. Rivalled by the unbroken chorus of bards uttering the song of salutation, Sanskrit verses in his praise from other cities, the work of skilled master-poets. As a token that the King is as famous as Raghu's son or the victorious Krṣṇa‚ renowned in the world.
 [84.4] When the King has ascended the jewelled lion-throne, glowing brightly, His form is Soddhodani made visible, just arrived from the splendid abode of the Buddha. Evidently those in attendance by his side, being handsome and divine, are the Three Gods and the King of the Gods, For their ornaments are equally superior, as is to be expected of eminent, esteemedpersons.
 [84.5] The Princess of Pajang and her husband take up the first place in the procession, Her throne has moved off escorted by countless troops, The officials of Pajang and the officials of Paguhan as their companions in contingents, In vast numbers and wearing their finery, with followers, flags, drums and soon.
 [84.6] Likewise the Princess of Lasëm with her husband come behind with their followers, And the Princess of Kaḍiri and consort, with nobles and troops behind; The Princess of Jīvana comes behind them, with a host of servants and with her husband, And the King is the last, the eminent ministers of all Java accompanying him innumbers.
 [84.7] Look at the people in dense crowds, crushed together without a gap as they watch – By the side of the highway the carts have been drawn up side by side as lookout-stands. The gateways have been decorated on either side like flags, and inparticular
 [84.8]the lookouts have been adorned; Numerous are the vomen, young and old, not to mention those who fill the forecourts, gathered in groups.
 [84.9] They are excited and happy, as if they are watching it for the very first time! Let us not relate what they do; in the morning the King is blessed, emerging into the Outer Courtyard. The leading priests give him holy water – the precious jar is of the best and its salver is finely made; The officials and paməgət then come before him to offer 'flower-homage', vying with each other.
  canto 85: 
 [85.1] In the first half of Cetra the hosts of subjects gather to consult and take counsel together: All the officials, officers and headmen and especially the King's troops join in. followed by the provincial officials, the juru and buyut, as well as the people of other cities. Not to mention the nobles, royal priests and in particular theBrahmans.
 [85.2] The purpose of the meeting is to ensure that none of His Majesty's subjects be undisciplined in what he does. But follow the teachings of the Raja Kapa-kapa which is read aloud every Cetra; Let him not trespass on what is forbidden and take to heart therules
 [85.3]regarding the right clothing and so on to be worn. And the property of the gods he is not to lay hands on, so that the city may be safe and sound forever.
  canto 86: 
 [86.1] Two days later the King devotes his attention to a celebration: There is to the north of the city a famous field by the name of Bubat; Whenever the Princes come there, they are carried on thrones, each one different from the others. And all their servants surpass a procession - the people watching are veryamazed.
 [86.2] Now Bubat is formed like a treeless plain, very flat, bare and wide; For half a league it extends to the east, as far as the royal road. And a quarter of a league to the north, as far as the bank of the river; It is surrounded by the dwellings and camps of the officials, in large numbers and arranged ingroups.
 [86.3] The Constructions in the centre are tall, their height is quite amazing and splendid; Many of their posts are carved depicting Parva stories neatly set out. The King's quarters are on the western side of this, as Compact as the palace in the interior – This is where the King takes up his lodgings when the month of Cetra has arrived and he mounts the lookout-pavilion.
  canto 87: 
 [87.1] The stands are arranged in a row to the north, facing west; On the northern and southern sides of the King the nobles are closely set. The high officials and Superintendents of the Law are the ones facing east and sitting in order – In front of them it is very wide, like the breadth of the greatsquare.
 [87.2] This is the place where His Majesty, being concerned for others'good,
 [87.3]presents a 'treat for the eyes': Those who are willing to risk injury engage in duels and general fights; They do var-dances with daggers drawn, others box or compete with ropes, thus causing amusement. And sometimes this goes on for three or four days, and then he goes straight home.
 [87.4] When the King has returned Bubat is deserted and the stands are pulled up; Now that the duels have been broken up it is all the more pleasant; In the Waning of Cetra the King entertains all the contestants -Given Clothing and food they are happy to take leave and go home.
  canto 88: 
 [88.1] All the various elders and chiefs were now not in a hurry to return homeand
 [88.2]came to take leave in the interior: Ārya Raṇādhikara accompanied by the governor of Trung next morning came into the presence. And Ārya Mahādhikāra‚ the juru and five tanda as heads of the padələgan Were their companions as they took leave while the King gave audience to them gathered there.
 [88.3] Then the Prince of Wëngker spoke, addressing the gentry and chiefs: 'You people should not be insincere in your loyalty and in the devoted love with which you serve our lord! You must be steadfast in the duties of the Weśya class, in anything that will bring about the prosperity of the country districts, stick to that! Bridges, main roads, varingin-trees, houses and so on and all kinds of useful public works must be put inorder.
 [88.4] The main thing is the ricefields, dry and irrigated -- whatever is planted, letit
 [88.5]be fruitful, guard it and cherish it! Any land that has been made into village land must continue so, and not become neutral ground. And so the inhabitants should not push off to other areas when they open up new land. This is the regulation that has to be followed -- it is the expansion of the country districts that should be striven for.
 [88.6] Prince Kṛtavardhana approves the size of the districts to be made; But let the number of hearths within their borders be counted at the end of each month. You should join in taking account of the presence of evil-doers, in the first place those who try to slip through the gate unobserved – An increase in the King's possessions is the fruit of it, his means of protecting theworld.'
 [88.7] His Majesty the king of Majapahit addressed them with gentle words, speaking unhurriedly: 'Sāmya means of course that your manifestation of this should not be achieved in a visama manner; When there are duties for the King, the "door-tax" is the main one – letno
 [88.8]one fail in this. And when entertaining guests you should also try to consider who you are and adhere to the characteristics of a sāmya.
  canto 89: 
 [89.1] And the essence of the regulations from the reign of the Queen Mother should be followed: In the morning when it is light let people cook all that will be eaten when entertaining guests; If there is anyone who acts wildly among those being entertained,causing
 [89.2]distress and being violent. follow up the whole complaint – no matter what it is, we must be informed.
 [89.3] For the palace and its own area are like a lion and a deep wood: If the fields are mined, then the city too will be short of sustenance. If there are no subjects, then clearly there will be other islands that come to take us by surprise. Therefore let them be cared for so that both will be stable; this is the benefit of my Words toyou.'
 [89.4] Thus he addressed the chiefs. Who replied respectfully; As one they declared that they Would not fail to comply With all that the King had said. The officials and assessors appeared before him, and also the nobles now came into his presence; Dong! The third hour struck, so let us tell about his meal assembled with themthere.
 [89.5] The north-eastern hall was where he took his place – it had alreadybeen
 [89.6]splendidly adorned. And in the three halls along the sides the leading chiefs were seated in order together. The superior dishes arrived, the trays all made of gold; Promptly those bringing them forward took up positions before the King.
 [89.7] His food consisted of mutton, buffalo, poultry, venison, vild boar, bees. Fish and duck, in keeping with the teachings of the Lokapurāṇa. Dog, donkey, worms and rats are forbidden, as well as frogs which are very low – Insolent enemies and a wasting of life are the defects they cause if this rule be broken.
 canto 90: 
 [90.1] The food intended for the common people arrived. Complete and all of silver were their splendid dishes; Countless meats, everything on land and in the water. Quick-sticks! Soon they came down in succession, one byone.
 [90.2] Frogs, worms, donkey, rats and dogs – The many addicted to these were inundated and their greed satisfied. Because of the fact that the people differ from district to district. All these likes of theirs were gratified, and that made themhappy.
 [90.3] All sorts of delicious drinks followed each other without a break: Coconut-palm toddy, lontar-palm toddy, arrack from the aren-palm, kilang, rice-wine And tampo, only the best was set there before them in quantities; The trays were all gold and of various differentsorts.
 [90.4] Jars and pots were spread roundabout in countless numbers. And very many were the kinds of alcoholic drink, made from various ingredients. Endlessly the drinks passed to and fro like streaming water – They gulped as much as they felt inclined, some threw up and others passedout.
 [90.5] It is the custom of kings when giving a feast That those who are addicted are also approached – the liquor flows freely. It would not do to give instructions as to the conduct of someone who is completely carried away. And as for those who become too bold while in a state of drunkenness, they get laughedat.
 [90.6] The singers were merry, and singing in turns The King's works they expressed in song, deeply moving. The drinkers became all the more content, taking as much as they liked. And when finally they could take no more, they ended up laughing together.
  canto 91: 
 [91.1] Juru i Angin was making witty remarks with her great-grandmother,cracking
 [91.2]joke after joke; She came on acting to the words of a song as she went to fetch each of her companions. The things she did caused laughter and pleased the audience. And so she was given pieces of clothing by all the chiefs.
 [91.3] Finally she was ordered to go before the King and to join in serving drinks there. And so she went with the officials and assessors as they served and sang. The singing of the Manghuri and Kaṇḍamohi was praised again and again. And the King, himself an expert, would cap it, deeply touching andbeautiful.
 [91.4] The King's songs put them under a spell, amazingly apt. Comparable with the cries of a peacock on a branch in their poetic beauty. Like honey and syrup mingled in their delightful sweetness. And resembling creaking bamboos in their awesomeness, breaking one'sheart.
 [91.5] Ārya Raṇādhikāra had neglected to address the King, So Ārya Mahādhikāra joined him to say together That the nobles desired to watch him perform raket – Ah!' was all he said, and went back to make animprovization.
 [91.6] Prince Kṛtavardhana acted as pañjak for him in the meantime; There in the hall in the centre it was hastily arranged. His Śori was a singer, and his Tëkes was Rahajeng – Seeing that it was for the sake of amusement, it simply arousedmirth.
 [91.7] He withdrew when the King arrived to take up his role: His song was of a different kind, causing the onlookers to be delighted. His Śori was brisk, fittingly handsome and accomplished. And the latter's song made veiled allusions, giving the onlookers deeppleasure.
 [91.8] The King was exceedingly handsome, in his full costume. And he had eight Tékéses who, being his minor wives, were truly beautiful. They were of noble descent, clever and thoroughly versed in what to do. So when he did the jesting-scene they let comments drop that were to thepoint.
 [91.9] In this way he went right through the Navanāṭya and took it as his starting-point. With farce as first principle – the laughter was constant, in unison and unbroken. And also pathos, which made people weep, inspired sorrow and ended in tears. So that the audience were overwhelmed withemotion.
 [91.10] When the sun was sinking low in the sky, then the King concluded. And the nobles took leave of him, wiping their lord's feet. They said they were freed from evil, given a joy as if not of this world – Let us not describe their praises of the King, Who had already returned to theInterior.
  
chapter : 
 canto 92: 
 [92.1]. This is how he partakes of pleasures in the palace and indulges his every desire. Without too much thought for self, he does not neglect to care for the Welfare of others for the benefit of the realm. He is youthful and not yet fully mature, but even so a Buddha in visible form, having exceptional qualities. Through his especially pure knowledge, which is his means of dispelling the villainy of thewicked.
 [92.2] His heroism has no end, while his majesty soars as high as the sky – Indeed an incarnation of Śrī Girinātha has become manifest in him as he brings about the welfare of the world. It is evident that one encounters calamity by resisting his commands or deviating from duty. And those who are constantly in his presence are freed of their impurities if he should happen to see them and especially if he should speak tothem.
 [92.3] Such is the cause of the King's excellence, renowned and praised in the three worlds – All the people, from high to low, utter songs in his praise. The one thing they pray for is that he may continue 'as long as the hills last' to be the shelter of the world – May he imitate the time that Sun and Moon shed their light on the face of the earth!
  canto 93: 
 [93.1] All the scholars of other lands compose the praises of our King: Śrī Buddhāditya the monk has made a eulogy on him in countless verses. In India is his home, a place called Kāñcīpuri of the Six Monasteries, And also the priest called Śrī Mutali Sahr̥daya has presented praises in faultlessverses.
 [93.2] Not to mention the scholars of Java, all who are expert in the scriptures and highly knowledgeable Discuss and compose verses, and sometimes it is in prose texts that they depict him. Mainly the praises of the King are to be found in eulogies, the work of the Sudharmopapatti, Who understands about songs; the songs he has composed when composing eulogies are widely known in the palace.
  canto 94: 
 [94.1]. The man by the pen-name of Prapañca feels obliged to follow, seeing the master poets in the palace, / And join in depicting the praises of the King; his composition could hardly become well known at court, / Its only use is as praise at the feet of Lord Girinātha — may it be graciously received, / No more than a petition that the World should prosper, and in the first place that the King remain firmly on histhrone.
 [94.2] In Śaka ‘mountains-elephants-suns’ (1287, AD 1365), in the month of Aśwayuja, at the auspicious moment of the full moon, / Then the Poet closes his description of the King’s qualities as all-conqueror in the realm. / Because of the number of districts set out in order and its aim of recording them in a book, let it be called the ‘Depiction of the Districts’ —/
 [94.3]May it be a means of raising the King’s good opinion, should he recall him Who has long humbled himself for poesy.
 [94.4] The time he has spent in often composing kakawin and producing bhāsaon
 [94.5]his tablet has been wasted: The first time it was the Sakābda, the second was the Lambang and When that was finished the Parwasāgara. So now the fourth is the Bhīṣmaśaraṇa and the final one is the Sugataparwa-Warṇana; It is the Lambang and Śakakāla that he goes back to, seeing that they grow and are not yet finished.
 [94.6] His aim in doing all this is that he should become more experiencedwhen
 [94.7]composing for the King, but even so he is not yet thoroughly accomplished in poetry;
 [94.8]The depth of his devotion and the love for his King are the reasons why he
 [94.9]insists on joining those who laud him. Sanskrit verses, kakawin and kidung are his praise for the King, in the first place the Deśawarṇana; All he has to lose now is face – Without doubt he Will be laughed at, but What can be done? Let him accept it.
  canto 95: 
 [95.1] One's natural reaction. When constantly bored by an awkward young lady in a village Is to be disagreeable, humourless, withdrawn and to have no sweet conversation; I am simply honest, true and good – how very hardhearted of her to abandon me! Why then, what is the use of knowing the Laws of Love if they are to befruitless?
 [95.2] This is the reason for weaning myself from the objects of the senses andnot
 [95.3]being attached to affairs. Blind and deaf, ignoring everything, tired of the pain of being abandoned. May the instruction of the Great Sage penetrate and be grasped in the heart, Always attending to the two kinds of religious observance and hence not going away or abandoning them.
 [95.4] Carrying that out is no different from performing austerities in thewooded
 [95.5]mountains and hiding oneself away, Making a secret house and a place for offerings, absorbed in extinguishing memories. Kamala (lotuses) are its courtyard, and high asana trees are planted there: Karnalasana is its name; it has been drawing me for a long time.
  canto 96: 
 [96.1] Prapañca took delight in five things: Putting on a funnyspeech-defect,
 [96.2]Going red in the face, refusing to go to bed, Having erections, and suddenly cracking jokes.
 [96.3] Disorderly and in no way to be followed, Not expert and not according to the rules, The order of the story bears the mark of Tantri – To be reproved as yielding and repeatedly worsted.
  canto 97: 
 [97.1] It is with blemishes that Pu Wināda strives, Strives for numerous gifts when it is time; Ignorant as to the essence of what should be done, He is indifferent to feelings of approval byothers.
 [97.2] Wināda takes refuge in meritorious deeds, And when given gifts he is without cares; If one allows him to cause sharp pain, An ascetic speedily givesguidance.
 [97.3] He clashes truly, daring to give fight, His fight is just begun, he is not yet skilled; He would never falter, for the Void he strives, His striving is heroic, he is fíerce in quietude.
  canto 98: 
 [98.1] As is natural to poets by the pen-name of Wināda when doing penance only perfect observances are adhered to, Benevolence and favour to those who long, equanimity toward those who have had enough and are averse to action, Renouncing pleasure and wealth unless what brings true happiness can be found, Without noticing or seeing the conduct of those blamed and found wanting in theInterior.
