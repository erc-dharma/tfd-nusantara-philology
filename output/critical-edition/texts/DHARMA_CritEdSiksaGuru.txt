colophon:  iti śikṣā guru ṅaranira.       translation : 
  [1.1]I will first teach the servant of the dharma as follows. You will succeed in listening to the discerning of the holy dharma and the firm state of the holy gnosis. There is what is called the pure circle of three bodily domains, uttered by the teacher to the servant of the dharma. Look, I would say they are the action, speech, and mind. If there is filth in your heart, it is they that should be given full attention and restrained. Guard them very well, for they are the causes of finding joy and sorrow, good and bad.
 [1.2]If your action, your speech and your mind are unrighteous, in that case you surely obtain the wrong. If your action, your speech, and your heart are righteous, in that case it is clear that you obtain the virtue. That is why there is a proverb “Thus as one repeatedly baths, the water is touched by the inherent nature of the human: bad meets its bad, good meets its good”. Likewise is human nature.
 [1.3]What are the illustrations with regard to the consequence of this, (namely): bad from its bad, good from its good? As follows is your analogy: there is what is called the priceless jewel, its value can not be known, being incomparable in terms of beauty. The meaning is: the priceless jewel and the most coveted jewel. Is it fitting to be bound to bell-metal, copper, and tin by you? What is the appropriateness (of such a condition)? It is evident that if its splendor and its shine come out, then your binding for the priceless jewel and your tieing for the most coveted gem in such a manner are appropriate.
 [1.4]These are the words of the holy treatise: ləpas ca vuṅkunuṅ ceva, adhika udika tatte tatur tathya tuṅgəṅ. This is proclaimed (etad eva nigadyate). Because what is considered loose hair is square hair (? vulu pasagi); there is the uḍika, the tater, and the lice. Are all of them appropriate to be bound to the priceless jewel and chained to the most coveted jewel? No, it is not like that; they should be bound to the bell-metal, copper, and tin. Why is that appropriate? The binding to the priceless jewel, the chaining to the most coveted jewel, these are the words of the holy treatise: ləpas ca vuṅkunuṅ ceva, adhika udika tatte tatur tathya tuṅgəṅ nu yogyanika.
 [1.5]There is what is called the glowing gold, beautiful gold; its value is one kati. The course of action will be (as follows): it is mixed seven times seven (times), transforming into the weight of one tahil of stone. How can it be strong, not undulating, unwavering, when it is set ablaze again? For only in this way is the best quality of all the gold, and then your binding of priceless jewels and your tying of the most coveted jewel are appropriate and good.
 [1.6]It (i.e. gold) is bound with bell-metal, copper, and tin, its splendor and its shine are not coming out. What are the reasons why they are not appropriate? Wrong innate (disposition), wrong karma, wrong nature. Just so is the holy supreme dharma: it is a priceless gem. And also your body: it is the most coveted gem.
 [1.7]Here is the analogy of bell-metal, copper, and tin: they are not appropriate to be bound to the priceless jewel, (and be) tied by you to the most coveted jewel.
 [1.8]They are as follows: bad actions, improper speech, and impure minds towards all humans — especially toward scholars. The meaning is: bad actions, improper speech, and a dirty mind are really not appropriate; the holy dharma shall be reflected upon; furthermore, protect (it) in your body, and even more so with respect to holy men. No, it is not proper (to have improper speech, etc.): repeatedly your birth (arises); one stops to desire having a child, having a wife, building a family, having relatives and a mother in law. He is unable to protect (himself) from bad actions, improper speech, a bad mind towards all humans, and especially towards ascetics. How would your protection of your body be appropriate? That is ‘the glowing’ (santaṅva) according to the scholar. It means the glowing gold: the good action, the good speech, the good heart. Those should be protected by (means of) the holy dharma.
 [1.9]As follows is the reason why it is called the pure circle of three bodily domains, according to the scholar: tri means three. The circle of three bodily domains is pure. So it is said. Thus are the three bodily domains, according to the scholar.
 [1.10]As follows is the beginning of the affection of a scholar toward the servant of the dharma. It is pure in good thought. Do it quickly! Do not be tucked in with dirty thoughts. The heart and mind are pure. Then, purify the mind and the set of your emotions! You should be aware when thinking; you should practice the activity of begging for alms (bhikṣā-lakṣanam) with full attention.
 [1.11]Here are your characteristics, O holy man. Do not just be attached to servants. It is evident when the hair has been cut. Cut it (so that) there is no obstruction or hindrance. That is the purity (pariśuddha): you should cut it before and you should control it. It is what is called †r̥kr̥t† gold, and making flower offerings with water. In this manner you serve the scholar. Do not commit the sin of violating the guru’s bed (guru-talpaka), (which is) a misfortune for the world; (rather, you) should fear him. You should be devoted and submit to the teacher, you should carry out (acts of) extreme respect toward the teacher, including scholars. (In this manner you) come to the realization of that goal.
 [1.12]In this manner you are the servant of the scholar, and even more so of the king. Do not be unfaithful toward the king. (You) will be fined and hated. You should be afraid of him, so that you will not be sold and die horribly. You should be loyal to the king: that is why (you) come to the realization of that goal (i.e., avoiding being sold and dying). You elder (rāma), kalaṅ, gusti, vizir (patih) in the village (banva), (should behave) in this manner. Furthermore, (concerning) the quality (dharma) of a balanced mind in people like you, you should not have an unbalanced voice in the legal proceeding, do not lean left and right with respect to good and bad qualities. It is not appropriate (as the) behavior of an experienced man, says the holy scriptures. That (wrong behavior) should not be followed by you, that is the reason why (if you follow it) the three domains of body and mind (trikāya maṇḍalam cittam) are not achieved. Then the servants of the dharma should devote their full attention to what is called ‘the sacred circle of the three pure bodily domains’. It is the beginning of the affection of the scholar toward the servants of the dharma.
   [2.1]There is a second (type of) affection of the scholar toward the servant of the dharma, which is called the ten rules (daśa-śīla). They are the following: ears, eyes, nose, tongue, mouth, skin, hands, genitals, anus, legs. This is what the servant of the dharma should hear.
 [2.2]Śrotra means ears. What is the sphere of the ears? They serve as a gate to hear the bad and good words. When you hear sweet and fragrant words, your heart becomes comfortable. When you hear a bad word, its fault is evidently unthinkable. Please do not repeat it. A good action for the teacher, that is what the servants of the dharma who are deaf in hearing the scriptures of the hermit should endeavor to carry out.
 [2.3]Cakṣuh means eyes. What is the sphere of activity of the eyes? To see good and bad, which causes joy and sorrow. How could they (i.e., the eyes) cause joy? They serve as your instrument to see the good deeds. You are without hindrance by means of that. How could that bring sorrow? From them (the eyes, saka rika), you should see the gold of the other fellow human beings. You walk to a public place, you see people with disabilities, leprosy, invalidities, goiter, (a stomach affected by) starvation (? buḍaya), defolded, stiff and rigid (limbs), all kinds of frightening appearance that exist in humans, let alone those who are blind and deaf of the eyes and ears. Furthermore, do not hurt somebody who has disable bodies. You should not be like that. It is called avoiding strong emotion (caṇḍa-parihāra), for the innate nature and karma are not seen. Also, people hurt because of it, that is what the servant of the dharma should pay attention to.
 [2.4]Grhāṇa means nose. What is the sphere of activity of the nose? It serves as an instrument to smell fragrant scents (surabhi), bad smell (asurabhi), (and) extraordinary smell (asādhāraṇa). Surabhi means fragrant, asurabhi means stinky and musty (odor), asadhāraṇa means singed smell (haṅit). Therefore, the kinds of smells are three. When you smell the fragrance, your heart is happy; when you smell a stinky and musty (odor), your heart is not happy, then your anger appears; that is the cause for the inappropriate speech to arise. The three bodily domains of ultimate truth (trikāya paramārtha) are not experienced. That is the reason why the sphere of the nose must be properly paid attention to and seriously cared after by the servants of the dharma.
 [2.5]Jihvā means tongue. What is the sphere of activity of the tongue? It serves as an instrument of tasting the six flavors, namely: salty (lavaṇa), spicy (kaṭuka), bitter (tikta), sour (amla), savory (kaṣāya), sweet (madhura). These are called the six flavors (ṣaḍrasa). Lavaṇa means salty, kaṭuka is spicy, tikta bitter, amla sour, kaṣāya savory, madhura sweet. Those are called the six flavors (ṣaḍrasa). Furthermore, they are all enjoyed by you; you will be oblivious of everything but becoming sick because of them. You shall not do so. Its object (i.e. the tongue) becomes a goal to be realized. That is a sign that you will abandon good works toward the teacher. If so, then the pure circle of three bodily domains is not experienced.
 [2.6]Vāk means words. What is the sphere of activity of the words? Not every word should be followed by you: harsh words (equal) aggressive behavior. In the situation of powerlessness and in trouble, you do not make other human beings feel at ease. However, what you should speak are words that are sweet, gentle, (with) an agreeable (facial) gesture. All kinds of things that make them indifferent to the world, and which are heard in succession by human beings, that is how you guard your words.
 [2.7]Tvak means skin. What is the sphere of activity of the skin? To feel and experience heat and cold. The point of this is the effort to restrain the passions that emerge from the skin.
 [2.8]Pāṇi means hand. What is the sphere of activity of the hand? To join the fingers of the hand, to join (the hands) when talking to the teacher. Also not to join the hands together with the teacher, and especially not to point the hand toward the face of the teacher; when the food of the teacher should be grasped, it should not be touched with the mouth. Or, do not take the teacher’s divine-property (drabya hyaṅ), let alone of any (kind of) people. This means do not be disloyal if he has a request. There are “sword leaves” in the sacred texts of the hermit. Such is what you should do to guard your hands.
 [2.9]Pāyu means anus. What is the sphere of activity of the anus? It is circular (utər) and joint (saṅga). Defecating (and) farting (as appropriate) are the ways in which you guard the anus. You should not fart in front of the teacher of men, you should not be in front of people when you defecate. (These behaviors) are not ordered by the teacher, and by all the religious wanderers (paramābhyāgata). Such are the ways in which you should guard your anus.
 [2.10]Upastha means sexual organ. What is the sphere of activity of the sexual organ? To feel sexual pleasure (and) to urinate. The meaning is as follows: to urinate, it should not be done in front of the people, especially those of high birth: male, female, servant, noble man, low, medium, and high. Since its maruruca (?) is great, the sins of becoming a human being comes out. What is considered as its sins? You see a man that is sold. His sins are his (way of) seizing women: misbehaving toward friends, misbehaving toward the teachers, taking by force forbidden women. The body vehemently becomes dirty if it is as such. (That) must be paid attention to by the servants of the dharma.
 [2.11]Pāda means the feet. What is the sphere of activity of the feet? To walk wherever is your destination, whether you go to the north, south, west, east, or to sit in a sila position. Then the way to guard the foot is: not kicking, not assuming an impolite posture, not (assuming) an unstable posture, not to lean sideways, not to lie stretched out, not sit by dangling the leg in front of the teacher, (or) of all religious wanderers. This (is the way) to guard the foot, (which) should be made the object of full attention by the servant of the dharma.
   [3.1]As follows is the third affection of the scholar to the servant of the dharma. Here are the five instructions, as they are called, namely:
 [3.2]Non-anger, obedience to the teacher, purity, moderation in food, and non-inattentiveness are the five known as particular commandments.
 [3.3]Non-anger (akrodho) means: it doesn't happen that a servant of the dharma shows his anger in front of the teacher, let alone to all good men. Obedience to the teacher (guruśuśruṣā) means that you are devoted and obedient to the teacher, never far from the feet of the elders. (It should be) that way if there is an order from the teacher. Furthermore, (you should be) completely pure: the highest reality of three bodily domains should be made the object of your attention, that is good act, good speech, good thought. The pure circle of three bodily domains, together with the ten rules and the five instructions should be made the object of your efforts whether (you are) far or near. Thus is called the obedience to the master. Purity (śauca) is to clean your hand when you hold the food of the teacher, let alone the properties of the scholar. Moderation in food (āhāralāghava) (means) you are swift (while) eating; (however, if) the balls of rice are big, and (your) eating quickly is uncontrolled, don’t (act) like that! That is called the belly palace (kukṣi-pura). How could (that) be the way of eating? It is only the vital breath with control (prāṇa sadhāraṇa) the daily means of subsistence of one who thinks about the Holy Good. These are what are called the five instructions, which should be made the object of attention by the servant of the dharma.
   [4.1]As follows is the fourth affection of the scholar to the servant of the dharma. This is what is called the instruction of the dharma, here it is—the śloka about it is as follow:
 [4.2]Writing, laughing, singing, yawning, and pure (from) the secret of fruit (?), one shall not do in front of the teacher.
 [4.3]The meaning is (as follows); ālekhyam means: do not write on the soil, do not write on the board, let alone on your body, when you serve the teacher, because there are those who are considered men with good characteristics, (but) constantly writing their thighs when talking with the teacher; hasitam: not to laugh in the front of the teacher, let alone to make a joke; gītam: not to sing—the manner of not claiming expertise, if it is not ordered by the teacher; jr̥mbhanam: not to express hunger (and) satiety in the front of the teacher; kaṇṭhāravam: not to yawn; †akadanəm† do not stretch a body (and emit sounds) in front of the teacher; śuddham phalarahasyam: not to talk in a selfish manner in the front of the teacher, let alone to pronounce the name “penis”; it is forbidden (to do) so. What is called na karotu gurumukhe, its meaning is as follows: the servant of the dharma should not do (that).
 [4.4]As follows is called the instruction of the dharma (dharma-śikṣā).
 [4.5]śalākāñjanam suravile paṇadantagharsādhyasta ceva, maprayāsamagama ceva masva ceva mibuḥ, kramaviduḥ ceva nervayude uddatayudena kaləm suparigrahaste.
 [4.6]The meaning is, śalākāñjanam: not to use eye-paint in front of the teacher, (or) in front of forbidden women. Suravile: not to open the mouth wide when one talks, let alone when one sits in sila position, not to use unguent, not to use powder, if (one is in) a place for the service to the teacher, let alone (where) his water stream springs forth, or (in) the pavilion for welcoming (guests). Dantagharsā: not to chew a quid (susur) when you speak to the teacher. Adhyasta: without the ornaments of the performers, (of those) who play musical instruments, and (of) the kecaka dancers. Hārahataḥ: not taking a pointed lance (measuring) one vilah. Prayāsamāgama: not to stare at each other with a forbidden woman, let alone the wife of the teacher, (not) to carry civet-cats (luvak) along with prey, not to occupy oneself constantly with eating and drinking in front of the teacher. That is called the instruction of the dharma (dharma-śikṣā); (it) should be made the object of the attention of the servant of the dharma.
   [5.1]As follows is the fifth affection of the scholar toward the servant of the dharma. How is it? As follows:
 [5.2]gurutalam pravakṣyāmi mahāyānam hyatistanti, durbage hinarsabekṣaḥ sakābhyāsa praṇamyāsīt
 [5.3]This is the foot soles of the teacher, pravakṣyāmi: (I) will explain the sacred virtuousness. ahāyānam hyatisṭānti those eminent ones were in the past—Buddhist, Śivaist, servant, noble man, inferior, middle, and superior, men or women. Their aim was to collect the sacred virtuousness as a book (?, vataṅ). In the first place, they were taught about the foot soless of the teacher. What is the reason? Thus: the teacher does not create misfortune. How so? The foot soles of the teacher was followed by them in the first place. Sakābhyāsa praṇamyāsīt: if you have followed the foot soles of the teacher within you, it is indeed praṇamya, i.e. the one who should be venerated properly (səmbahən). Səmbahən means: (someone) that should be obeyed. The meaning is:
 [5.4]anāma hīnavākyam ahi siṁharūpañ ca grahaste, gurusaṁghāsanam pritam gr̥hate namaniṁmate.
 [5.5]Anāma: the name of the teacher is not obtained (i.e., not to be mentioned). Hīnavākyam: not speaking about the holy virtue, not slandering the elder (teacher). Siṁharupāñ ca grahaste: (you are) seen to show anger toward the teacher. It does not happen like that. Saṅ guru saṁghāsanam pritam: you have to be quick: if the teacher is met on the way, or if the meeting happens in his own territory, the teacher should be revered. Also, not to speak impetuously to the teacher, let alone to precede the teacher's steps, not being in a hurry (?, avurugan) when you take a bath, not to step in the shadow of the teacher, not seeking the refuge from the teacher, not drinking the tvak of the teacher, not smelling the food of the teacher. Do not use the utensils of the teacher, unless it is asked. One should not be careless with the wife of the teacher, children of the guru, father and the senior of the teacher, possession (pesi) of the teacher, nephew of the teacher, or the teacher’s beloved ones, and the teacher’s abandoned wife. As such is what is called the foot soles of the teacher; that should become the object of the attention of the servant of the dharma.
   [6.1]This is the sixth affection of the teacher to the servant of the dharma. How is it? As follows: what is called the holy Misfortune of the World. How is it? As follows: bad meets its bad, good meets its good, crooked meets its crooked, straight meets its straight, joy meets its joy. What is indeed the condition of happiness and sorrow of all beings? It is you, not anyone else, the pure circle of three bodily domains. The meaning is: because from the action, speech, and heart is the joy, and the joy and sorrow. You know the cause of the bad conduct which is the cause of misfortune: that is why the good conduct is to be performed, so that (it is) not affected by the misfortune. This is what is called the world of misfortune. It should be made the object of the attention of the servant of the dharma.
   [7.1]There is the seventh affection of the scholar to the servant of the dharma. It is called the holy four powers (caduśakti) of the scholar. What is the reason why it is called caduśakti? The four powers mean its powers. They are used as weapons by the scholar. What are they? As follows: the formula (cakra) of jalakuna, the formula of jalapakṣa, the formula of arrangement (or: multitude?, sambharaṇa), the formula of the arm like stars (taraṅgabāhu).
 [7.2]As follows are the kinds of misfortune (brought) by the scholar upon those who undertake spiritual practice. (If) the one who undertakes spiritual practice dances at the bottom, the jalakuna is the means of the scholar to (cause) misfortune at the edge of the bottom-world to the one who undertakes spiritual practice at the bottom. At the bottom, four are those who undertake spiritual practice in the bottom-world; they dance in the sea, diving in the whirlpool of the ocean. Jalapakṣa is the means of the scholar (to cause) misfortune to the ocean. Four among those who undertake spiritual practice from the ocean, they dance in the north, south, west, and east. The cakra sambharaṇa is the means (to cause) misfortune of the scholar to the north, south, east, and west. Those (who undertake spiritual practice) dance at the edge of the upper part: the formula taraṅgabahu is the means of the scholar (to cause) misfortune to the edge of the upper part. The edge of the upper part is vanished, burnt, conquered by the weapon of the learned master—below, above, and all around horizontally.
 [7.3]As follows are the kinds of the four powers that serve as a weapon of the scholar. The world and the whole universe are filled by weapons. The meaning is: be diligent in action, be diligent in speaking, be diligent in breathing, in order not to be affected by misfortune. It is what is called the holy four powers, that is the instruction of the scholar, that should be made the object of the attention of the servant of the dharma.
   [8.1]Here, as follows would be the true meaning of what I will tell to a man like you, a man who causes the realization of the one who wishes to know his gods and their high value, the holy supreme dharma, and the beginning and the end of the current human life. That is the reason why one obtains the holy doctrine of the jewel (ratnopadeśa) originating from the reverend elders. There are what are called the three pacified bodily acts. You should be striving for them and should really pay attention to them, for those are the origin of the bad and good, joy and sorrow of the current human life. You see people who are killed, beheaded; their father and mother are plundered and sold, their relatives are enslaved, their fathers are dragged into fields. What is the reason for this? The lack of diligence in practicing the holy three pacified bodily acts. The meaning is: without practicing it, they obtained sin and great misery. If you would speak like this: “Just in the same way, o Sir, (they) are affected by misfortune from that, the holy pacified bodily acts indeed … the life/humans, that is why (there is) limitless pain, and misfortune in the world”. Likewise indeed, sir, (you) are affected by misfortune from it. (When) the holy pacified bodily acts (are possessed by) the humans, that is the reason why (they) are not affected (pahiṅan) by the great misfortune in his world. Those (words) are probably what I would say to you.
 [8.2]I would say to you as follows: there is what is called pacified thought, pacified act, pacified speech. The pacified thought means a good mind, not plotting against people and not causing the sorrow of other people, let alone not causing chaos in the world. That is what is called pacified thought. The pacified act means the proper deeds, good deeds, correct deeds, not chastising (and) not causing harm to people. That is what is called the pacified act. The pacified speech means good words that are pleasant to hear by the people, not causing the extreme sorrow of other people, especially with one’s words. That is called pacified speech. Tri means the three: the pacified act (is) to make people’s mind at ease. If it is held fast by him, those who are born as humans will not be affected by misfortune, if it is so.
 [8.3]When (one) holds fast to his badness, his badness is called the three defects (tri-mala). Three defects means three evils. As follows are their appearances: evil mind, evil act, evil speech. The evil mind means a mind plotting against fellow human beings, causing the suffering of others, (and) creating disturbance for the world. That is called the evil mind. The evil act means improper acts, bad acts, and incorrect acts, causing disturbance for the world, let alone causing the sorrow and death of his fellow human beings. Here are their kinds: stealing, plundering, poisoning, using black magic, striking, using mantras for invincibility, striking innocent peoples, because of his wish to obtain wealth and pleasure. Those are regarded as evil acts. The evil speech means the words that are not pleasant to be heard, causing confusion to his fellow human beings, such as abusing, being envious, speaking evil, envy for his fellow human beings, calling black magicians those who do not use black magic, accusing of stealing those who do not steal, calling enemies those who are not enemies, calling evil the holy man, (as well as using) uncontrolled speech (and) harsh speech. Those are regarded as evil speech. Those are regarded as the three defects. When the evil mind serves as the men’s mind, evil act serves as the men’s act, (and) evil speech serves as the men's speech, the misfortune of the world clearly strikes.
 [8.4]How is the one who has misfortune called? His appearances are, for instance, blind, deaf, leper, with a scar (vikət), stiff handed, hunchback, out of breath (?, səkəl), suffering from monocular blindness; all types of body diseases are his appearances, let alone stiff body (?, kərəṅan), all kinds of deformed (bodies)—those are the miserable conditions (pāpa). The reason why those miserable conditions (affect him) is that evil thoughts, evil acts, evil speech are performed by him, like stealing, striking, poisoning, using black magic. Those are performed by him. When you die, you will become a centipede (?, tətək), a caterpillar, a small snake (vəḍit), a leech, a worm (?, lakay), a leatherleaf slug, a worm əlur; all kinds of horrible creatures, those are regarded as the punishment, (that is) the right order of the cauldron. Those would be the (post-mortem) transformations. They should be really avoided by the scholar. (Then), what should be performed by him?
 [8.5]Om! The holy three pacified bodily acts indeed are that which you should be continuously performing and repeatedly practicing. For now and in the future’s future, the holy three pacified bodily acts indeed are what should be held fast by you. They serve as a boat, they serve as an ark, and they serve as a ship. The pacified thought serves as the boat, the pacified act serves as the ship, the pacified speech serves as the ark. He is what is called the real holy man, he is what is called the lord among yogins, he is the scholar, (and) the hermit. What is the explanation for it? What caused the transformation (in the cycle of rebirth) is passed over by the scholar.
   [9.1]As follow is the explanation:
 [9.2]This (condition of) defilement and sin having disappeared, and those who are afflicted having disappeared, They do great meritorious conduct.
 [9.3]The meaning is: it should be able to purify ten defilements (daśa-kleśa), if they arrive to you, that is vice (doṣa), ignorance (moha), greed (drəmba), cupidity (lobha), jealousy (mātsarya), arrogance (abhimāna), stupidity (mūrkha), cheat (kuhaka), idle talk (sambhinna-pralāpa), calumny (peśuna).
 [9.4]The meaning is: the vice (doṣa) means deeming oneself superior in happiness, deeming oneself superior in knowledge, deeming oneself superior in power. That is considered the vice. Ignorance (moha) means not having affection toward fellow human beings. Addicted to eating, drinking, and continuously sleeping, not exerting to obtain the blessed ending of human beings, that is called greed (drəmba). Cupidity (lobha) means a lot of actions are not in accordance with etiquettes. Jealousy (mātsarya) means being jealous to see the well-being (of others).

Idle talk (sambhinnapralāpa) means continuously thinking about the wealth of the rich and the happiness of the happy. Calumny (peśuna) means to deceive continuously. Those are what are called ten defilements (daśa-kleśa). Such defilements should be cleaned and destroyed.
   [10.1]Vigataḥ sarvaduhkhinaḥ (those who are afflicted having disappeared). Would you have the same probability of misfortune (mārakarma), if (it) comes to you? Misfortune means sleep (supta), fear (bhaya), laziness (tandrī), irresolution (kleda), shame (lajjā), lust for women (rāgastrī), adultery (paradāra), eating of food (bhakṣabhojana), dishonest consideration (kuṭilaviveka), madness (məta).
 [10.2]The meaning is: sleep (supta) is continuously sleeping, falling asleep when asking about the goodness, and of his excellent qualities as a human, falling asleep when causing enjoyment, also when speaking of goodness to fellow human beings. Fear (bhaya) means being afraid to ask about the blessed ending of human beings, being afraid to render service to his teachers, being afraid to speak of goodness. Laziness (tandrī) means being lazy to ask about his ignorance, being lazy to cause enjoyment, and to speak of goodness. It is called laziness. Irresolution (kleda) means being hesitant to cause enjoyment and being hesitant to ask about the blessed ending of human beings. Shame (lajjā) means embarrassed to ask about his own ignorance, embarrassed to render service to his teacher, embarrassed to render service out of his happiness. Lust of women (rāgastrī) means being keen on desiring to have a wife and desiring happiness. Adultery (paradāra) means to steal a forbidden woman. Eating the food (bhakṣabhojāna) means being mad to have for oneself what one’s fond of (i.e. food). Dishonest consideration (kuṭilaviveka) means to postpone to cause the enjoyment and to talk the goodness to the fellow human beings. Madness (məta) means to be intoxicated by his happiness, intoxicated by his wisdom, intoxicated by his knowledge, intoxicated by his qualities. That is called madness. If the mind is like that, it should be cleaned and neutralized by you.

Their kinds are as follows: donation (dāna), morality (śīla), forbearance (kṣānti), strength (vīrya), meditation (dhyāna), wisdom (prajñā), compassion (karuṇā), sympathy (mudita), friendship (metrī), endurance (upekṣā).

Those are called ten grounds (daśabhūmi). The scholar constantly practices such attitudes.
   [13.1]As follows is what should be made an object of attention by the servant of the law, in order to not be affected by the misfortune of the world and a painful rebirth. There are the pacified: pacified speech, pacified act, pacified mind. Guard the goodness only, in order to not be affected by the causes of sorrow, that is to say: the sorrow from the elements, the sorrow from the gods, the sorrow from oneself.
 [13.2]The meaning is: if you are affected by the misfortune, by five gross elements, died from being bitten by the snake, being struck by lightning, bitten by the crocodile, crushed by branches, devoured by the tiger, death on the battle, intercepted, beaten up, died of falling from the trees, plundered, died by being strangled with the cord, all kind of weapon (which cause) the death in the battle, they are the sorrow from the elements.

Condemning furiously, lamenting, deceiving, being angry all the time, disapproving, bewitching, backbiting, challenging, rude speech, scolding without reason, they are called the evil speeches. What are called evil acts: slapping, punching, pushing, stabbing, clasping, all kinds of hand actions, they are called the evil acts. What are called evil minds: poisoning, offending, being envious of what is right for fellow humans, they are called evil minds. The origin of sorrow is by your acts, by your speeches, by your minds.
 [13.4]If you are afraid of misfortune, do what is called the pacified speech, pacified act, pacified mind, (that) should be made an object of attention by (you), the servant of the law, so that (you) are not disfavoured. The pacified speeches means a pleasant speech, good speech, heart-stealing speech, sweet speech, sweet and fragrant speech. Those are called the pacified speeches.

Thus was the lesson of the scholar called the doctrine of the teacher (śikṣā guru). That is the reason why the servant of the dharma should dedicate himself to it.
   [14.1]Thus is the Instruction of the Teacher.
