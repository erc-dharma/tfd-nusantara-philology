 [1.1]Here is the name of the holy book: The Holy Instruction of the Great Teacher (Saṅ Hyaṅ Sasana Mahaguru). Sasana means the legacy of the ancestors, maha means more superior than the superior of the world, guru means the source of all the universe.
 [1.2]There is your analogy: like the priceless jewel and the most desirable gem, it is the source of the joy and sorrow, the bad and the good. Its explanation is as follows: world (buh), intention, knowledge, determination, total willingness.
 [1.3]The meaning is: The world is the Holy Earth. When it is beautified, degraded, upgraded, littered, mingled, it does not fall and it is not indignant, it is not weak and it is not restless, forcefull and firm in performing earthiness (kaprativian). That is indeed the thing that the servant of the dharma should practice.
 [1.4]Intention means the water. Its benefit is when (it) emerges from its upstream. It gushes clear, and it feels cool. Moreover, it also had no obstacles, reaching the ocean. That is what the servant of the dharma must emulate.
 [1.5]Knowledge means the wind. Its benefit is when it blows  from the west. It blows with coolness, (and) feels smooth on our bodies. Moreover, it will not be obstructed when it appears at the right moment in the world. That is what the servant of the dharma must emulate.
 [1.6]Determination means fire and weapons. Because of their natures (ti iña), they are to be used by people whose minds are determined.
 [1.7]Willingness means the Holy Sun. When it rises from the east, it is not impeded by clouds, rain, smoke, and fog until it reaches the west, because of the concentration on one action (only). That is what the servant of the dharma must emulate. We should not fail to be mindful toward the holy original cause. The following are called The Five Knowledges (pañca-vedani).  Panca means five, ve means water, dani means broomstick.
 [2.1]This is called the precepts for society (siksa kandaṅ), the precepts of religious groups (siksa kuruṅ), the root’s precepts (siksa dapur). The meaning is: the precepts for society are around yourself. To encounter the adultery, the adultery of ‘The Journey’ (and) of ‘The Sitting Place’. That is what we should keep in mind. Then let us be careful, in case we enter the yard, entering the inner place, it is not comfortable (if we are) not their inhabitants. That is called the precepts for society.
 [2.2]When we are on a journey, it is not proper to commit a deceitful act because of the commodity of someone else’s farm, or someone else’s vegetable grove. Therefore, “hiris will smash the ear when the bean smashes the forehead”: to collect what people put down temporarily (tunda), to take something clearly owned (by another), (or) to bring down someone else’s tap (sadapan). It is improper to defecate on the side of the road, for it would be smelt by those who are careless, for it is possible that you will be cursed and be blamed (by) mother, father, and teachers. We should not fail to wear loincloths and full attire; if we meet a gusti or a minister, we should be on their left (and) bow. Those are called the precepts for society.
 [2.3]The precepts of the religious group (siksa kuruṅ) are to be one action with the scholar. After all, it is not good to make trouble of which has been deliberated, violating the holy precepts. If we are aware of the sections (of the books) and their binding cords (ləkər-ləkər), their dandas,lines (sipat), enclosures (galəṅ), their strokes, their compositions, their boundary, their limits, all the imprints of the God Brahmā and Viṣṇu when they delimited the world. That is called the precepts of the religious group.
 [2.4]As for the precepts of the root is to reach the core, to obtain the origin by one’s devoted and truthful mind toward the scholar. That is called the precepts of the root. Those are called the precepts for society, according to the great scholar.
 [3.1]As follows is what the servant of the dharma should be aware of, (that is) the original cause of the holy scripture, the form of stain in the past until present.
 [3.2]Here is the beginning of the holy scripture. Its form is as follows: after the sun had set, the night replaced (it). Satisfaction and pleasure are the cause of the way of appearing, (thanks to) the reality of time of the Goddess Durgi. The God Gana’s instrument (jantra) trumpeted, so that it was sprayed towards humankind in the middle realm, and it turned into gebang and lontar. (When) the time came for the gebang and lontar to form young leaves, they followed precisely the same pattern with respect to their width and length, (so that they could have) asta gaṅga vira tanu applied.
 [3.3]What is the asta gaṅga vira tanu? Asta means hand, gaṅga means water, vira means pen and brush, tanu means ink. They are used for writing by the scholar, for reading by one without knowledge to increase the range of the sounds, which is constrained (according to the rules) by the poet.
 [3.4]In the first place, the ten origins will be narrated. Oṅ Saraswati the excellence mind and the thought-gem. Let the eyes of God Bayu widely open. Let there be the embodiment of Lord Guru, the accomplished ancient masters from the earth, the accomplished ancien masters from the sky: Kusika, Garga, Méstri, Purusya, Patañjala; also breath, speech, and mind; let alone The Witness, for He is the one who counts.
 [3.5]As follows are what are called the ten origins (dasa-purva). Dasa means ten, purva means the origin. Those should be taken notice by the servant of the dharma, according to the scholar.
 [3.6]Postphone! All that emerges from the narrative (carita) should be followed; (yet) the essence of The One (saṅ hyaṅ tuṅgal) is inactive. For what purpose am I uttering this mantra? Well, it is because I know that I wish to produce letters: writing on gold, writing on silver, writing on copper, writing on knives (?, cudiga), writing on iron, writing on stone, writing on wooden strips, writing on bamboo (?, pəjva), writing on lontar, writing on gebang.
 [3.7]Writing on gold is called ‘transcendent ruby and gold’; its form and its result is beautiful, for it may not be stored. Perhaps many do not know this, so once again it is passed down: writing on silver is called ‘silver’ (kanaka).

 [4.1]The One said, “What is the purpose of this holy book? Because I know that I will produce the composition, being the emergence of The Teacher’s Precepts (Siksa Guru), from the holy precepts.”
 [4.2]Here, as follows, is the pure circle of three bodily domains. This is what should be thrown out; the servant of the dharma should not follow that (i.e. tri-mala) — (for it is) the source of sadness, the origin of the sins leading to misery, the beginning of the kali’s era, the cause of the sins leading to hell — the three stains so it is called.
 [4.3](As far as the) categorizations (are concerned), their comparisons are as follows: what is called the three defects is like bronze and wax, copper and tin. What is comparable to copper and tin?

There is the one who claims for himself, there is the one who hears, there is the holy floating jewel. It is called the ten personalisations.
 [26.1]These are called the ten highest principles. These are the explanations: there are ears, there is hearing, there is the hearer, there is the highest principle. There are eyes, there is viewing, there is the viewer, there is the highest principle. There is nose, there is smelling, there is the smeller, there is the highest principle. There is tongue, there is taste, there is the taster, there is the highest principle. There is the mouth, there is the speech, there is the speaker, there is the highest principle. There is the skin, there is the touch, there is the toucher, there is the highest principle. There is the hand, there is the grasping, there is the grasper, there is the highest principle. There is the anus, there is the releasing, there is the releaser, there is the highest principle. There are the sexual organs, there is the urinating, there is the one who urinates, there is the highest principle. There are the feet, there is the walking, there is the walker, there is the highest principle. Those are called the ten highest principles.
 [27.1]These are called the ten pacifiers. This is their explanation: donation (dāna), morality (śīla), forbearance (kṣānti), strength (vīrya), meditation (dhyāna), wisdom (prajñā), compassion (karuṇā), sympathy (mudita), friendship (metrī), endurance (upekṣā).
 [27.2]The meaning is: donation (dāna) means to give enjoyment to others. Morality (śīla) means to know etiquette (tvah). Strength (vīrya) means to strive to be continuously truthful, to strive to do goodness. Meditation (dhyāna) means to consider his own mind. Wisdom (prajñā) means to be quick to get rid of the bad things of oneself. Compassion (karuṇā) means his heart would be weak while thinking for himself and does not want to make others sad. Sympathy (mudita) means not to forget the others’ skill. Friendship (metrī) means to know the good deed, to make the others feel at ease. Endurance (upekṣā) means not being bothered by the good and the bad. Those are called the ten pacifiers (dasa-pasanta).
 [28.1]This is what should be seriously done, what is called the ten grounds. These are the verses:
 [28.2]agəm rahayəm gunyam | tvah citane haləm | kurvanti kuśalam mahat
 [28.3]The excellent meritorious conduct should be carried out. The excellent meritorious conduct means: love (asih), devotion (bhakti), persevering effort (prayatna), respectability (gorava), honesty (duga-duga), calmness (śānta), compassion (karuṇa), sympathy (anumoda), consideration (anumāna), respectful mutual dependence (ālambana atəaṅ). Those are called ten grounds.
 [29.1]These are called the ten superiorities (dasa-visesa). As follows is the meaning: the Holy hearing is not heard, because He is the one who hears, the Holy one who cannot be used as hearing. The Holy sight is not seen, because He is the one who sees, the Holy one who cannot be used as sight. The Holy smelling is not smelled, because He is the one who smells, the Holy one who cannot be used as smelling. The Holy taste is not tasted, because He is the one who tastes, the Holy one who cannot be used as taste. The Holy speech is not spoken, because He is the one who speaks, the Holy one who cannot be used as speech. The Holy touching is not touched, because He is the one who touches, the Holy one who cannot be used as touching. The Holy grasping is not grasped, because He is the one who grasps, the Holy one who cannot be used as grasping. The Holy release is not released, because He is the one who releases, The Holy one who cannot be used as releasing. The Holy urinating is not urinated, because He is the one who urinates, the Holy one who cannot be used as urinating. The Holy walking is not moving, because He is the one who moves, the Holy one who cannot be used as motion. Those are called the ten superiorities.
 [30.1]These are the ten supreme superiorities (dasa-mahavisesa). The Holy organ of hearing is materialized in your body, it is supreme because of the Supreme One. The Holy organ of sight is materialized in your body, it is supreme because of the Supreme One. The Holy organ of taste is materialized in your body, it is supreme because of the Supreme One. The Holy organ of speech is materialized in your body, it is supreme because of the Supreme One. The Holy organ of touch is materialized in your body; it is supreme because of the Supreme One, (for the organ of touch itself) is not superior. The Holy organ of grasping is materialized in your body; it is supreme because of the Supreme One. The Holy organ of release is materialized in your body; it is supreme because the Supreme One, (for the organ of release itself) is not superior. The Holy organ of urinating is materialized in your body; it is supreme because the Supreme One, (for the organ of urinating itself) is not superior. Those are called the ten supreme superiorities.
 [31.1]These are called the ten non-superiorities (dasa-tan-kavisesa). The meaning is as follows: There is no hearing, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning in yourself. There is no sight, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning and vice in yourself. There is no smelling, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning in yourself. There is no taste, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning in yourself. There is no speech, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning and vice in yourself. There is no touch, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning in yourself. There is no grasping, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning in yourself. There is no release, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning in yourself. There is no urinating, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning in yourself. There is no walking, nothing is materialized in your body, there is no means for sinning in yourself, none of them.
 [31.2]The meaning is: there is no one who hears, no one with form, no one who smells, no one who speaks, no one who touches, no one who grasps, no one who eats, no one no one who drinks, no one who tastes, there are no divine (embodiments) for them. Those are called the ten non-superiorities.
 [32.1]Furthermore, my lesson for the servant of the dharma is as follows: There is what is called the four splendours; it is (also) called the four principles. This is the meaning: (they) serve as the boat, (they) serve as the ship, (they) serve as the ark, (they) serve as the junk. What is compared to the boat is the pacified act, what is compared to the ship is the pacified speech, what is compared to the ark is the pacified thought, what is compared to the junk is the stable (and) pacified awareness. They are called the one of Siddha-nature (sidajati), the lord among yogins (yogisvara), the scholar (pandita), the men of religion (viku). Those are called the four splendours, those are called the four principles.
  [33.1]These are called the four purities. The pure and transparent jewel is still, the pure jewel is clear, the pure jewel is white, those are the pure seat of thought (cita).
 [33.2]The following is also to be taken into account carefully. There is what is called the origin of goodness. It is that which is extraordinary and very secret. It is the holy virtue.
 [33.3]This is called the release, the holy purity. It is called the four final liberations (catur-mokta): release, disappearance, vanishing, dissolution. That is called the four final liberations. That should be kept in secret by the servant of the dharma.
 [34.1]This is the six and two. The meaning (is in the words) ndah saṅ hyaṅ hayu. The meaning is: nən is like the king who thinks, who reflects carefully when he is on the sacred throne, emerges from the condition of stability. That is called nən. The dah is the willingness to present the possessions to the king, elders, hermits, ritualists, and sailors. The saṅ means, it is said, single; there is certainly no second, and also no third. What is called hyaṅ is the relic of the past. What is called hayu means lightweight, it is said, the body is like a flower-bud and a kapok fiber. Those are the truths. That is the one who aro ṅe?
 [34.2]This is the meaning of two: that is one man (and) one woman, it is called two. Three means the king, the elder, (and) the hermit, 3. Five means Brahma, Wisnu, Iswara, Mahadéwa, Siwa Sangkara; Kusika, Garga, Méstri, Purusya, Patañjala; Indra, Yama, Baruna, Kuwéra, Bésawarna. That is called the five gods. Seven means: the seven underworlds, the seven middle worlds, the seven upperworlds, the seven voids, the Absolute. That is called the account of the creation (kalpa-carita).
 [35.1]These are called the three in number: three categories (3), three inconclusive (propositions) (3), the means of knowledge (4), the artificial knowledge (4). These are the breath, the speech, and the people’s mind, which surround (narivrəta) the world, which sink (? ñəluman) into the trees, into the rock, into the earth, into the water, into every kind of plant, into the animals (3).
 [35.2]These are the three (existing) in the scholar. It is called the tiga sadana: tiga means three, sadana means element.
 [35.3]These are called the three truths. This is (the syllables) a, ña, (and) na. That is called the three true words.
 [35.4](Pupil): “Where can the three be found in the scholar? Show your favour to your son (by revealing) about the location where the a, the ña, and the na can be found!”
 [35.5](Teacher:) “So be it. As follows. First I will explain the equality and the difference, your means to know the truth of the three. What is the meaning of the vari, srigadiṅ, (and) asoka flowers? You should explain! Are they identical?”
 [35.6](Pupil:) “So be it. They are different, my lord. The vari flower is still the vari flower. The srigadiṅ is still the srigadiṅ, the asoka is still the asoka, my lord. Please tell (me) your words.”
 [35.7](Teacher:) “The three are like that, the means to evaluate the equality and the difference in a sincere, truthful, rightful, and clearly perceived manner.”
 [35.8](Teacher:) “First of all, here is the instrument to evaluate the equality and the difference of the a. What is entering and exiting by means of the nose and of your mouth, upamāna praveśanam, (and) its use in your body?”
 [35.9](Pupil:) “The wind as breath, my lord. That is what is called a, according to the scholars.”
 [35.10](Teacher:) “As follows is what could also be asked regarding that (issue). What is the name that is heard, as the thunder and thunderous noise of all beings? What are the(ir) names, according to you?”
 [35.11](Pupil:) “The sound, my lord! That is called the ña, according to the scholars.”
 [35.12](Teacher:) “As follows is what could also be asked, there is nobody who knows about it. What is the meaning of that which is caused by you to reach the limit of the world: north, south, west, east, (and) in a wink it crosses the ocean, disappears and comes back again in an instant? What is your opinion, my son?”
 [35.13](Pupil:) “The mind, my lord! That is called the na, according to the scholars.
 [35.14]That is the reason why they are called breath, speech, and mind, which are spread through the world. Those are called the three instruments. They are the means to reach the world; (they) are used as a support for all beings.”
 [35.15]These are the activities in the body. Bayu serves as the vital principle, entering and exiting your nose; it serves as your breath. It is considered right, correct, and clearly perceived. It is called the truth in the body. Sabda means the speech. It is used to define the bad and the good, to name vowels and consonants. It serves as your speech. Hədap means the mind, your thoughts directed towards the near and the far.
 [35.16]The a is the breath, the ña is the speech, the na is the mind. (They are) the content of the three knowledges (tiga ajñana), which are the first argument of the scholars. They should be taught (as follows:) tiga means three, ajñana means the place to be reached (kasampəran). It is the Great Supreme (4).
 [36.1]Furthermore, this is called the innate knowledge. It can not be given to the pupil, it can not be faked. The knowledge and the real are the origin of the Supreme One.
 [36.2]This is the excellent (principle), the origin of joy and sorrow, what is pleasant (and unpleasant?). That is the reason why (it is) the origin of power and strength, the origin of being respected, the origin of being endowed, the origin of being venerated in the case of the scholar. As for the existence of the breath, speech, and mind in your body: if the breath, speech, and mind vanish in your body, (it means that one) ceases to be venerated, (and) ceases to be worshiped.
 [36.3]The mind is used as the mind by wisdom. The mind is manifold. It is the truth and correct. It is truly perceivable in the body. It is called the three truths. Tri means three, təpət means superior.
 [37.1](Teacher:) This is their union. The “straight” is the thought, far and near. Its entire life and its targets are not hindered by the difficulties. It reaches the edges of the world-egg, (including) heaven and the underworlds, unseen during day and night. It is called “to achieve the ultimate” (boṅboṅ botos) and “to completely dissolve” (buṅbaṅ ləpas). Those whose desires, all (of them), are true and rasti (?) are leaving without being noticed. What is the meaning of such (teaching)?
 [37.2](Pupil:) (This is) the thought indeed, my lord.
 [37.3](Teacher:) That is the holy knowledge, according to the scholar. It is the union of the three truths. When the beauty (of knowledge) is thrown away, it is called the carcass. That is the reason why supreme knowledge is the origin of ultimate excellence.
 [37.4]What is the form of what is called the truly priceless? This is your metaphor: like the court filled with the gold, jewel, (and) priceless clothes of the worthy king. All of that is truly priceless. Thus (far) about the existence of the holy breath, speech and mind. Thus is the supreme knowledge in your body.
 [37.5]Indeed, the holy knowledge regarding the living as a householder (momah), of breathing, of speaking, of thinking is no other than the holy supreme knowledge. Its meaning is to be kept as a secret by the pupil of the scholar.
 [37.6](Pupil:) So be it. This is fortunate.
 [38.1](Teacher:) This is my word, the endless wisdom. Is there any breath, speech, and mind in you, my child?
 [38.2](Pupil:) Yes, they exist, my lord.
 [38.3](Teacher:) Is it seen by you?
 [38.4](Pupil:) No, my lord. It is proper to regard it as existing. Anything that is felt and touched, it exists in the world and in the body, my lord.
 [38.5](Teacher:) Such (answer) is true. Does the speech exist?
 [38.6](Pupil:) It exists, my lord.
 [38.7](Teacher:) Such (answer) is true. Is the speech seen by you?
 [38.8](Pupil:) No, it is not seen, my lord. It is proper to regard it as existing. All that is heard, it exists in the world and in the body, my lord.
 [38.9](Teacher:) Does the mind exist in you?
 [38.10](Pupil:) It exists, my lord.
 [38.11](Teacher:) Is it seen by you?
 [38.12](Pupil:) No, it is not seen, my lord. It is proper to regard it as existing. All that is thought, far and near, exists in the world and in the body.
 [38.13](Master:) You are right to know in this way. That is the reason why what is called the Holy Invisible (essence) is clearly perceptible; it exists perpetually in the body and (in) the world, there is nothing else.
 [38.14]This is the activity of the breath, the speech, and the mind: the appellation of the breath, speech, and mind (3), the demonstration of the breath (6). This is the five tasks ordered by the king (5), the five organs (5), the teaching about the way to vanish (3), the highest truth (paramarta) (4), the ultimate isolation (4), the eight supernatural powers (8), the section of knowledge (3), kisiñan;(?) (8), unperceived by faculties (anendriya) (3), the gross and subtle elements (4). These are the numbers of the section of knowledge; the servant of the dharma should pay attention to them.
 [39.1]This is called the addition (2), the state of the vikus (4), the naming (and) the personalisation (of) the reverend teacher. This is what should be made an object of attention by the one who searches for the truth. (It is) the holy knowledge: the reason that (it is) the possession of one who possesses, the reason that it is not used as a possession, like the enjoyment (of consumption) (boga), enjoyment (of living properties) (pariboga), enjoyments of appearance (rupaboga). What is that which is called boga, pariboga, (and) rupaboga?
 [39.2]As follows: what is called boga is food and drink; pariboga is the slave, servant, buffalo, cow, any kind of livestock; rupaboga is gold, jewel, fine lower cloths for a worthy king, that is, the ornaments of a divine king. The possession is the supreme knowledge, to be used as the embellishment (and) as the ornament of the substance of the individual (vastu si vvaṅ).
 [39.3]In addition, O child of the scholar, what will be thought should be absorbed, about what is called the substance of the individual.
 [39.4]Let it be so! (I) teach you as follows: what is called a worthy person is the one of true being (saṅ sat-hana), (which is) not created. It is the source. It is called the root of the origin and the end. It is called pure nature. It is called the source of the mother and father. It is regarded as the secret. It is called the paramount dharma, who carries out all the actions in the world. He creates without joining (all the other beings in) being created. That is why what is called “Someone” (si anu) does not come from the treatises, does not come from the teacher, (but) it is from oneself (na śāstrataḥ na gurutaḥ svataḥ).
 [39.5]The meaning is: na śāstrataḥ (means) cannot be found by the means of scriptures and wisdom; na gurutaḥ is kaimariṅun (?). What is sought (by him) is penetrated and filled. It cannot be used as a means, it cannot be instructed, by (ri) the teacher. It is only from oneself. It exists without being made into existence: no wife, no son, no relatives, no mother, no father: (it is) from oneself. The meaning is: na bhārya is not having a wife, na putraḥ is not having child and grandchild, na mātā, na pitam svataḥ is not having a father, not having a mother.
 [39.6]Avismṛtidṛṣṭi (the sight of one who is not forgetful). He sees without being seen, knows without being known, embodies without being embodied, blows the vital air (into other beings) without being blown the vital air into (by any other beings), speaks without being spoken, thinks without being thought. He appears just at the same time with his body, his breath, his speech, and his mind, in the embryo-abode in the past. When he appears in the external (world), he is called “Someone”.
 [39.7]That is the reason why the Someone else is called the one having difficulty, namely, its ignorance about the world and the universe is extraordinary, is not knowing the father and the mother of the whole world, and the child of the world. Who is the one who is knowledgeable? It is only the scholar, no one else.
 [39.8]O, child of the learned master, “Someone” will emerge from what are called parents.
 [40.1]Indeed, the following is my love for you (5). These are the varis flowers. The meaning is as follows: varis flowers means cotton, the color means a thread, the cognition (vri) means fabric.
 [40.2]The meaning is: what is called varis flowers is the body, what is called the thread is the mind, what is called fabric is the individualized divine emanation (saṅ hyaṅ pramana).
 [40.3]The meaning is: he uses his mind as the sight, he uses his two eyes as the gate, he uses his breath as the vital principle, he uses his speech as the means of realizing, he uses his body as the abode, he uses the world as the gate.
 [40.4]The ‘red’ is a color, the meaning is that (he) knows what he sees. The gate to see the varis flowers is the two eyeballs. The instrument to see the varis flowers is the mind. It means that he knows his sight. Who is the one who sees the varis flowers?
 [40.5]It is you, son.
 [40.6]The skill (3), the truth (1), its panatab (?) (3), the liberated soul (9), inconceivable, icaluṅ (?), i (?), to carry over the shoulder, ba (?), the big trees (kayu magəṅ).
 [40.7]This is the five gross elements (5), the five forms (of suffering), (5), the five paths (5). All of that should be made the object of the attention of the servant of the dharma.
 [41.1]As follows is the esoteric teaching, the beginning of the scholar telling about the (five) sections. The esoteric teaching (sandi) means the consciousness. It serves as the direction of the world and all beings. That is the reason why (every being in) the whole world does not (come to existence) with a wrong body and with a wrong condition. All the beings are following, in the right direction, their father and their mother, and their origin and particular nature: humans give birth to humans, animals give birth to animals.
 [41.2]What is called penance (tapa) is as follows. What is the essential meaning of it? The purity (si lilaṅ). What is the reason it is called purity? Its explanation is as follows: it is aware to have the world and the body as properties.
 [41.3]Likewise, the posture (luṅguh), what is the essential meaning of it? The firmness. It is true indeed that The Witness is firm in his knowledge of the manifest and unmanifest world. What is the firmness of The Witness in the manifest world? He does not follow along (others) in prioritizing sacred formulas, mantras, the mantra huṅ, a lotus-like hand (padmakara), and also performing worship and healing spells (jampa-jampya). You do not follow those in prioritizing the way of penance, observances, yoga, and concentration. He is not seduced by any kind of supernatural powers (guna). Those are the firmness of The Witness in the manifest world. What is the firmness of The Witness in the unmanifest world? He should not be involved in demonic (activities).
 [41.4]Likewise, the direct perception (pratyaksa), what is its essential meaning? The impossibility. What is the meaning of impossibility? This is its nature: Does The One know about the impossibility of the whole world being used as its world? No. Does The Witness know that the body is used as its body? No. Does the The Holy Dharma know that the smell is used as its smell? No. Does the Holy Virtue know that the colour is used as its colour? No. Does The Divine Emanation know that the breath, speech, and mind are used as its life? No. Does The Supreme One know that the speech is used as its means to define? No. Does The Holy Secret know that the mind is used as an instrument of thought? That is called the impossibility.
 [41.5]Where does the impossibility and the application of the impossibility come from? As follows: the consciousness in the mind. There is the most desired jewel, beautiful and fulfilling. The Witness is the most desired jewel and the great unconceivable one. It (manik sarvesta) is treated with much fondness by the holy dharma.
 [41.6]What is that which is called the most desired jewel, beautiful and fulfilling? It is the mind. What is the beautiful jewel belonging to ‘the creator (anuṅ vidi)’? It is consciousness. What is the beautiful jewel and the greatly inconceivable one? It is The Witness. Those are called the three secret words. The secret of the scholar is not found by the servant of the dharma.
 [42.1]What are called the three secrets, that is the breath, the speech, and the mind? Those which are called the three secrets are not the three means. The meaning is: what is called the three secrets according to the great teacher?
 [42.2]Indeed, as follows is its form: that is the mind, the consciousness, the witness. Those are called the origin of existence. What is the explanation of the origin of existence, my lord? The illustration about that is as follows: like the lamp, the flame, and the light.
 [42.3]Are the flame and the light identical, my lord?
 [42.4]No, they are not like that. The flame, the light, and the fire are different. The flame and the light are coming out from the fire. Their outcome dies with the fire, going back to their origin; their original condition dies.
 [42.5]What is its explanation? Prepare the torch already! Its nature is to suddenly flame firmly, and at the same time, is to be extinguished. The appearance of the flame is (also) the appearance of the light. In a similar way they are extinguished. The swallow of the flame and the light, they are swallowed and vanished simultaneously. The mind and the consciousness, as well as the witness are likewise.
 [42.6]What is considered the fire? The individualized divine emanation. What is the flame? The mind. What is the heat and the light? The esoteric (consciousness). The meaning is: the mind, the consciousness, (and) the witness. Those are called the origin of existence (3).
 [42.7]This is the means of individualization, like the painter, the action (of painting), and the brush; like the bronze and the wax, along with the silver. The meaning is: the mind, the consciousness, the witness. Those are called the means of individualization of existence.
 [42.8]This is the meaning that the fire is different. What is the explanation? Prepare the lamp, that is, its wick is set ablaze. (The fire) that stands and flames, quickly shines. Its measure stands in the same direction (satuduhan). That is called the flame. What is spreading out (and) filling the house, it is called the light. What is shining as small as a fire-fly, and the red on the top of the wick, that is called the fire. This is the proof that the fire is different from the flame and the light. Where to the destination of the flame and the light? Does it go to void and non-existence? No, it is not like that.
 [42.9]What is the meaning of all of this, (about the fire) going to the void and non-existence? No, it is not like that. What is the meaning of all this, (namely) the flame, along with the light and its fire, going to the void and non-existence, according to another viku? No, it is not according to the scholar. You should not (say) like that.
 [42.10]Where would be the destination of the torch and its light? They go to the state that exists. The meaning is: like the egg, like the seed of mango, like the rice-straw, like planting in the rice field, like the flowers and the yarn, sa, a.
 [42.11]That is called the work of the Lord. This is the power of the Great One. This is the power of the Supreme One. Me means I, the one who truly exists, which is not created, the holy one who exists by itself, who creates which does not follow (others) in being created. Because I am the life-giving power which is not the embodiment of the living power (kapramanaan). I am the Supreme which is not the embodiment of the Supreme. That is called the three supreme secrets.
 [42.12]This is its means of tatab (? panatabna). The world has ceased to support, the body has ceased to serve as the abiding place, the breath has ceased to be the vital principle, the speech has ceased to be used as a means to put into effect, the mind has ceased to be produced, the consciousness has ceased to be the instrument of action, the witness has ceased to act upon. This is the explanation according to the noble master.
 [42.13]This is the means of their union (pamupul). The mind has ceased to be created, the consciousness has ceased to be used as an instrument to create, the Witness has ceased to create. That is called the means of the union.
 [42.14]This is the means of coloring (? pamulas). The mind acknowledges (? maṅku) that it has ceased to be made upon by that (tutur); the consciousness acknowledges (? maṅku) has ceased to create by way of that (hədap); the Witness, consequently, has ceased to act by way of people. It is called its means of coloring.
 [42.15]This is called its fixation. It is not seen. What is made and the instrument of action, let alone the one who acts are visualized. For the mind is subtle. It has ceased to be created. The consciousness is invisible. It has ceased to be created. The Witness is inconceivable. Those are called the process of fixation, of what is called the three secrets.
 [43.1]Likewise is the release. What serves as the secret by him to act? That is called the process of fixation. The creation (krataka) and the sharing task (si dum). The meaning is: The Witness will know the means to the act, (He) will know to arrange his acts in the material (and) immaterial world.
 [43.2]What is your analogy? Like the goldsmith. The one who gave the order comes. (He says:) “Please make for me a bracelet and a ring”. The smith says “I already abandoned my work. It was already given by me to the assistant. The occupation is abandoned by me. Already a long time that the skill was left by me.” The one who gave the order then left, he was looking for another smith.
 [43.3]Likewise also the individualized divine emanation. “The painter” has ceased to create. The Witness has ceased to cause the consciousness. All of them have ceased to be constitutive elements (of the human being). That is why that is called being apportioned (according to their original prerogatives): have limit without being limited with regard to their manifest and unmanifest activities. The meaning is: that is called the release according to the scholar.
 [44.1]What is called the epitome is like that. Seek the essence of the truth, without being turned into untruth! What is your analogy? Like the fibres of the palm rib broom. Their number being great, they are held together (?, kasigənan) by the single tie. All the teachings are like that.
 [44.2]The Holy Supreme, He creates what serves as the essence with respect to the direct perception (pratyaksa)*. It is true that the Witness knows about the demonic substance, which serves as the sin of the posture (luṅguh). It is true that the Witness will know about the one who has attachment which serves as its sin. The one without attachment serves as the supreme power in the penance (tapa). It is true that the Witness will know the unconsciousness which serves as its sin. The consciousness serves as its supreme power with regard to the esoteric (teaching) (sandi). Do not let the Witness join them, insofar that such (involvement) is sinful. Those should be considered cautiously by the servant of the dharma, according to the great scholar.
 [44.3]The following is called the beginning of writing. What is pointed out by the scholar about the beginning of writing, absolutely without any doubt whatsoever? What serves as the essence of it? As follows: the muscle of the right and left hands, the writing on the palms of the hands. Those are called the hands. There is nothing lacking in them, there is nothing that is slipping away from the moving hands.
 [44.4]The following is the second (part) of writing. Its form is as follows: the manifestation is the riddle words. It serves as the challenge of the scholar. What does it refer to? As follows: both pupils. The meaning is: the conduct of life is the conduct of speech; the meaning is: the conduct of intellect is the conduct of knowledge, the conduct of esoteric (knowledge) is the conduct of mind. Likewise, the individualized divine emanation and the supreme are united with the secret, their nature is to disappear simultaneously all together. There is not (even) the knowledge that they have already been released. They are the content of the second part of writing, according to the foremost master, which is paid full attention by the servant of dharma.
 [44.5]The following is the third part of writing, the beginning of the master discussing the secret, that is the origin of the self divine emanation. If one realizes its own self, that is the Supreme Dharma. It releases from the world, it departs from the body. The breath, the speech, and the mind are not embodied. Moreover, (they are) the ultimate void and emptiness, free from disturbance, pure, unobstructed. That is the perpetual dharma that exists in the body.
 [44.6]It continuously flames and shines, not being extinguished by day and night, also in the manifest and unmanifest (worlds). It has been shown based on the true nature (vastu) by the master. You should not have any doubt! They are the content of the third part of writing, which is paid full attention by the servant of dharma, it is the word of the lord of yogins.
 [44.7]The following is called the fixed number of four. The meaning is: life, death, sleep, and unconsciousness. Those serve as the place of the Witness in material and immaterial reality. They are shown by the scholar to the servant of the dharma.
 [44.8]The gross body is death. You see the body, small and little. It is seen for an instant only. As for the subtle body, that is regarded as sleep, it serves as your body while dreaming. As for the pure body, that is called the unconsciousness which is void, absence, and the ultimate reality. These are called the fixed number of four. The Witness, the life and the Soul does not manifest: clear, silent, unhindered; perpetual, steadfast, independent. All beings are like that. Those (i.e. kalakar pat) are called the king of sins. The King Witness does not manifest in material and immaterial world, meaning that it serves as the essence of the fixed number of four. It should be thought carefully by my child, the servant of the dharma, according to the lord of yogins.
   [45.1]The following is called the secret of the scholar. What is the detailed explanation of it? As follows, there is your analogy: like the Witness, after the individualized divine emanation is blissful (hayu), when it is released from the world, freed from the body, (it) being only the everlasting consciousness and the deepest point of esoteric knowledge. What is the everlasting consciousness and the deepest point of esoteric knowledge?
 [45.2]Their meanings are as follows: “As the fire (which is) in every piece of wood is not perceived because of (its) subtlety.” The meaning is: it is not found. You have ceased to be doubtful about it, you, the individualized divine emanation, have ceased to be hesitant, the holy supreme has ceased to be tremulous.
 [45.3]The meaning is: it is not heaven, nor the bad, nor the goodness, nor the joy, nor the sorrow. That is called the essence of death. The experience of The Witness in the material and immaterial (worlds). What causes one to give up the bad and the good, the joy and the sorrow, here in the world and the body, and in all beings? It is only the individualized divine emanation, nothing else. Those are called the secrets of the scholar; they should be clearly understood by the servant of the dharma, according to the noble scholar, 4.
 [46.1]As follows are the instruction words, the climax of the scholar who ceases to teach the servant of the dharma, the climax of the teacher who ceases to teach the pupil, the climax of the pupil who ceases to ask the teacher.
 [46.2]How is it so? As follows: like the jewel with the crystal, likewise are the scholar and the servant of the dharma. If they have understood about all holy dharmas, each of them, the servant of the dharma and the teacher are one, the one who teaches and the one who asks are united. The scholar has ceased to teach the servant of the dharma, the lord of yogin has ceased to ask.
 [46.3]The meaning is: if all of them already know, also, their individualized divine emanations are equally priceless, meaning that they equally return to their original nature. That is called the instruction words. It should be paid attention to by the servant of the dharma, according to the noble great scholar.
 [47.1]This is what should be paid attention to, the holy book called Sasana Mahaguru. It has been completely written in the fourth month. Accomplishing the writing at the region Mahapavitra on Mount Jedang. The product of an ugly side job. The one who writes is an amateur boy who weighs the gold. Apologize for the ugly writing like the trace of a crab in the sand. If something is missing, please add it, if it is too much, please reduce it, because it is the work of a stupid one.
