In 4235 etc., do you understand why there is 3x "lac. J1 (larger gap)" even though you do record J1 among witnesses for the <rdg>?

I have the impression that at least part of this list consists of terms for "hand" rather than "nail." Maybe it needs to be split up into two sections? But we don't seem to have sufficient evidence for a convincing reconstruction. If you reach that conclusion, you could just print the (minimally normalized) reading of J1.

Note that 
- pañcanakha and sumpiṅ do not express the same meaning as kuku. 
	maybe instead of pañcanakha, the original text has pañcaśākha, which means "hand"
- the word sumpiṅ is not even Skt., so it is doubly suspect.
	maybe emend to muṣṭi?
	but note 117 "śaya, ṅa sumpiṅ 9", while śaya is a synonym of "hand"
- ratabhuja, dvabhuja and prakoca do not exist in Skt. and are unacceptable. note that you have reinterpreted ms. ḍobhuja as dvabuja, but it could be a small corruption for dorbhuja. See the first kośa passage listed below.
