<head>May there he no impediments.</head>
<p>His Reverence Vararuci collected all the essentials of the Mahabharata, the
composition of His Reverence Vyāsa, to whom Vararuci pays homage in the
following verse.</p>
<quote>Obeisance to the Great Seer, of vast learning and supreme nobility, who dispels
the darkness of ignorance, the son whom Satyavatī begot out of her own being
from Parāśara, in the midst of an island.</quote>
<p>There was a great seer. There was nothing he did not know. He was
honoured in the three worlds. He dispelled the darkness of ignorance of all beings.
He was the son of Her Ladyship Satyavatī, begotten of her union with His Reverence
Parāśara. He was horn in the middle of the Kr̥ṣṇa island. His name is
His Reverence Vyāsa. Before this person should communicate the essence of his
wise composition, he must pay his homage to His Reverence.</p>

<p>As the very big ocean and as the Himālaya mountain are known to he the
mines of precious objects, so is the Bharata.</p>
<p>Now its superiority. As the ocean and the Himālaya mountain are the mines of gold, jewels and ol all precious things, so is this whole composition of his, i.e. the Mahābhārata, which is a dharmaśāstra. This (MBh.) is the ripe product of the superior rasas of primaeval esoteric knowledge.</p>



<p>This narrative is the eternal subsistence of master poets, just as a king of noble lineage is the subsistence of dependents who strive to rise.</p>

<p>Out of this excellent narrative are created poetic faculties. It is like the five elements out of which the mechanism of the three worlds is formed.</p>

<!-- differences in pādas cd -->

<p>There is no tale in this world which does not hang on this narration. It is like unto a body which maintains itself on food.</p>

<!-- @@@@ 2021-11-08 Arlo has revised the file using Ando2018_01 down to here -->

<p>After having heard this narrative another narrative will sound insipid. 
Just as after having listened to the notes of a male cuckoo, the harsh cries of a crow jar
on one's ears.</p>
<p>Something more about this excellence. If somebody has enjoyed the hearing
of this story how would it he possible for him to enjoy another tale or a song or a flute. 
When the music of a cuckoo has pervaded the heart with the sweetness of its melody 
then one would hardly find pleasure in listening to the cawings of a crow.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Bhagavān Vararuci while paying his obeisance to Bhagavān Vyāsa. 
Henceforth he will say what is best in this Bhārata epic. It is designated Sārasamuccaya. 
Sāra signifies essence. Samuccaya is its accumulation. It is the work of Bhagavān Vararuci. 
This didactic discourse was delivered at the time of the narration of the Bhārata epic 
by Bhagavān Vaiśampāyana to Mahārāja Janamejaya.</p>

<p>You, scion of the Bharata race, in the field of dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa, 
whatever is recorded here that is to be found elsewhere, and what is not recorded 
here is not to be found anywhere else.</p>


<p>Among all beings man alone performs good and evil acts. 
If one be engrossed in evil, he should be taken across towards good.</p>

<p>If one be devoid of prosperity one should not be unhappy about it. 
The human frame even though as a pariah is most invaluable.</p>

<p>This birth is the foremost, O King! Having acquired it one is able to save himself by noble deeds.</p>


<p>One who does not remedy the hell-disease while he is in the incarnation of man, 
what then will he do when he goes to non-human incarnations where he lacks the remedy
of doing conscious noble deeds.</p>


<p>Having acquired the human frame which is difficult of attainment and 
which forms a ladder to heaven, one should act in such a manner that 
one does not slip down again.</p>


<p>O Brahman, the human incarnation forms the domain of action. 
Beyond is the domain of enjoyments of their results. Whatever deeds are performed here,
they are enjoyed hereafter. The birth here below is the region of doing acts,
noble or ignoble.The next world is the region of enjoyment of the fruits of actions. 
The meaning is that the actions good or evil are done here while their
fruit is obtained hereafter, and when the enjoyment comes to an end, one is
again born in order to follow vāsanā for fruits of actions. Vāsanā is saṁskāra or
impression. It is the wee bit of odour that is left over. It is followed by punishment. 
He falls from beyond, which may be either heaven or hell. Now as regards
good or evil actions that may be done in hell or heaven, they yield no fruit. 
Hence one should perform actions good or evil in this world only.</p>


<p>Having attained the human body which is difficult 
to acquire and which lasts only as long as a flash of lightning, 
one should determine destroying existence and its instruments.</p>


<p>The person who having been born as a man, which is not at all easy, and who out of greed and because of having given himself up to passion, comes to disregard dharma, he indeed loses all.</p>
<!--ekba: How do we encode for the unknown item, Mas?-->

<p>Human birth is extremely difficult to attain. It resembles a flash of lightning.
If having acquired that one does not escape out of saṁsāra, one is undone.</p>

<p>I raise my arms and cry but no one listens to me. Artha and kāma flow 
from dharma. So why do people not pursue dharma?</p>

<p>Seeking kāma and artha one must start with the pursuit of dharma. 
By ignoring dharma there is neither artha nor kāma.</p>

<p>Respect is paid to a man of dharma, and not to one who is rich or given to passion. 
In riches one may find a bit of happiness, but in dharma there is absolute bliss.</p>

<p>For those sailing to heaven, dharma is the only raft. 
Dharma is the boat for merchants who must cross over to the other shore of the ocean.</p>

<p>One may make efforts for kāma, artha and mokṣa and fail, but an endeavour in dharma, even a thought, is not wasted. It bears fruit.</p>

<p>Just as the rising sun drives away all darkness, so stationing oneself in good one drives away all evil.</p>

<p>As one's mind advances in the enjoyment of doing good, so do all one's projects come to fruition. Here there is no doubt.</p>

<p>Dharma always brings benefit. It is the refuge of the noble. The three worlds, together with all that moves and that does not move, flow from dharma.</p>

<p>One, whose mind constantly treads the path of dharma and does not deviate, him they call the man of noble deeds. His kith and kin have no worry with regard to him.</p>

<p>Water that irrigates sugarcane helps the weeds too. Similarly, walking the way of dharma, one gains riches, fame and worldly desires.</p>

<p>Whatever one has sown, that one reaps—ample loveliness and charm, birth in a noble family, wealth and prosperity in high measure.</p>

<p>Men of dharma have no fear in inaccessible jungles and forests, in calamities, in difficult situations, in battle or when facing uplifted arms ready to strike.</p>

<p>Those who act nobly get as their reward lovely women after their own hearts. They reside in palaces.</p>
<!--ekba: It seems that attribute "sameAs" does not fit in this case?-->

<p>Friends and fortunes fly to men of noble acts, just like frogs hurrying to ponds and birds flying to waterful lakes.</p>

<p>The wise one accumulates knowledge and worldly goods slowly and steadily 
as if he would never come to end. But when he comes to dharma he acts as if he 
has no time to lose, as if death itself has caught hold of him by his hair.</p>

<p>If this person should perceive death which is standing on the forehead, he would have no taste even for food, let alone the taste for pursuing ignoble ends.</p>

<p>One should seek dharma, wealth and wisdom while still young. When old the blade of darbha grass bends and is unable to pierce. </p>
<!--ekba: same case as stanza 30-->

<p>One who remains unsubdued by passions in youth, he alone is termed restrained. When passions lose their fury in old age, restraint is natural.</p>

<p>A child looks forward to youth, a youth to old age, but having mounted into the lap of death, what does an old man look up to?
</p>

<p>First death, piloted by disease, breaks the human frame. So, when life declines, one must perform great good.</p>

<p>One should take to dharma while young. Life is uncertain. Who knows as to when death's armies will strike.</p>
<!-- Raghu Vira says "compare in a general way" MBh05,040.016; the correspondence is only very partial -->

<p>When one dies, his kinsmen follow him upto the burning ground, and return when the smoke has subsided. It is only his good deeds that accompany him beyond. Therefore it is these which he must cultivate.</p>

<p>People accompany the corpse, they shed tears for a moment, then they leave it as if it were a log of wood or a clod of clay, and turn their faces away.</p>

<p>Dharma alone is the highest good. Forbearance is tranquility. Knowledge is supreme satisfaction. Non-injury brings joy. </p>

<p>Had there been one single scripture, it would have been an undoubted gain. On account of the variety of scriptures good has been put into a deep cavern.</p>

<p>My child, do not insult or ignore the elders. Sit at their feet and learn. The ways of dharma are like those of the snake, fine and untraceable. </p>

<p>Śruti is the four holy Vedas. Smṛtis are the dharma scriptures. It is these two, śruti and smṛti, which have to be consulted in all matters. They hold the dharma.</p>

<p>The four divisions of society (Brāhmaṇas and others), the four worlds, as well as the four stages of life (brahmacārī, etc.), the past, the present and the future—all flow from the Veda.</p>
<!-- it would be nice to do without this punctuation -->

<p>Veda is to be supplemented with itihāsa and purāṇa. Veda is afraid of a man of little knowledge—he will strike (प्रहरिष्यति) me.</p>

<p>The highest dharma is taught by śruti. Another is the dharma laid down in smṛti. Still another is the behaviour of men of truth and piety. These three dharmas are ancient and everlasting.</p>

<p>Do not do to others what is disagreeable to your own self. This is dharma in brief. All else proceeds from kāma.</p>

<p>Follow the actions of pious men, who are well-restrained, who are devoted to truth and simplicity and who are treading the path of dharma. </p>

<p>Like a car's wheel, dharma revolves and covers an all-over domain. It is as hard to determine the exact nature of dharma as it is to determine the father of a harlot's son.</p>

<p>Listen to the quintessence of dharma. And having listened hold on to it. What you do not approve for yourself, that you must not do to others.</p>

<p>Empty grains among cereals, winged ants among birds–similar is the position among humans of those whose motivation is not dharma.</p>
<note>Kawi has misinterpreted puttikāḥ as pūtikāḥ 'rotten eggs'.</note>

<p>Common men are like weeds. They serve neither dharma nor kāma. They die so that they be born. They are born so that they may die.</p>

<p>There are persons whose minds are fogged and revile dharma. They go on the wrong path. Any one who follows them suffers torments.</p>

<p>The dull-witted have no interest in dharma. They are born as low creatures. Thus incarnated they attain no joy.</p>

<p>Earn the wealth which neither the state can demand nor the thief can take away, and again which one does not leave behind at death.</p>

<p>If one lives on alms and does not let dharma down, one should consider oneself rich. Dharma is the treasure of the virtuous.</p>

<p>If the practice of dharma should leave no scope for earning life’s requisites, water, herbs and grains can still be gleaned.</p>

<p>Herbs grow in forests. There are rivers with clean waters. The moon is the universal lamp. What more purpose can riches serve?</p>

<p>Even though engaged otherwise one attends to his interests in between. Carrying the yoke, the bull still finds occasion to make morsels of grass.</p>

<p>One should investigate the path of dharma, which is as inscrutable as the path of fish in water. To this end must be enlightened, restrained, controlled and ever active.</p>

<p>Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya and vaiśya are the three dvi-jātis ‘twice-born.'  Śūdra is the fourth. He is eka-jāti ‘once-born'. There is no fifth.</p>

<p>A brāhmaṇa must study, perform yajña, give alms, go on pilgrimages, teach others, officiate at other’s yajñas and accept the prescribed dues.</p>

<p>Dharma and truth, penance and subjugation of passions, absence of envy and modesty, tolerance and spitelessness, yajñas and alms, firmness and forgiveness – these are the twelve great vows of a brāhmaṇa.</p>

<p>A kṣatriya must study the Vedas, organise the fire, perform yajñas, protect the people, support his dependents, kinsmen and relatives, give alms. Thereby he goes to heaven.</p>

<p>A vaiśya should study with a brāhmaṇa or a kṣatriya. He should help his dependents with monies at the due time. By maintaining the three sacred fires and inhaling their sacred fumes he attains heaven and shares the pleasures of gods.</p>

<p>A śūdra should duly serve brāhmaṇas, kśatriyas and vaiśyas. When they are pleased and satisfied his troubles are over, his sins are burnt up. After leaving his body he accomplishes what he had aspired. </p>

<p>A cowardly monarch, an omnivorous brāhmaṇa, a non-aspiring vaiśya, a lazy śūdra, a depraved man of learning, a man of high birth without high conduct, a brāhmaṇa fallen from truth, a woman gone astray.</p>

<p>A vānaprastha or saṁnyāsī who retains attachment and cooks for himself, an unwise orator, a monarch-less land, and a family man who bears no affection to his children—all of them, O king, reach a deplorable plight.</p>

<p>Straightforwardness, kindness, restraint, control over one's senses—these, according to Manu, are the virtues to be cultivated in common by all the four varṇas.</p>

<p>Non-injuring, speaking truth, sincerity towards all, patience and vigilance make for happiness.</p>

<p>Whatever is crooked leads to death, whatever is straight leads to Brahma. This is wisdom in its entirety. Prolific talk is of no avail.</p>

<p>Kindness is the highest law. Forgiveness is the greatest strength. Knowledge of self is the supreme science. The vow of truth is the noblest vow.</p>

<p>Men always avoid thorns, dry wells, fire, men of vile activity and the depraved ones.</p>

<p>Restraint is superior to alms-giving. Alms-giving makes a man proud. He becomes angry, but not so a man of restraint. Hence the superiority.</p>

<p>Wetting ones' limbs with water is not bathing. He who is bathed with restraint is really bathed. It is he who is rendered clean inside and outside. </p>

<p>One who is neither exhilarated with great prosperity nor depressed by calamity, but has his mind completely under control, he is styled dānta.</p>

<p>Heaven and hell are our own senses. When we control them it is heaven, but when we let them loose it is hell.</p>

<p>Life, good behaviour, security, power, fame, dharma and prosperity are sustained and nourished by restraining the senses.</p>

<p>There are ten roads of action—three mind, four of speech and three of body.</p>

<p>One must cultivate three attitudes—no desire for other’s goods, kindliness to all creatures and a robust faith in the fructification of deeds.</p>

<p>One should neither think nor speak evil, harsh, slanderous or false words.</p>

<p>Murder, theft and adultery—one must altogehter avoid these three bodily sins.</p>

<p>Whatever one does with body, mind and speech, that carries him along. Hence one should do only that which is beneficial.</p>

<p>Rare is the person who is virtuous in speech, action, and mind.</p>

<p>Mind makes the decision. Speech follows it. Lastly it is rendered into deeds. Thus the mind is the chief.</p>

<p>Mind is the root whence the senses derive their activity. It is this mind which is to be properly ordained to serve in all states, good or evil.</p>

<p>Mind traverses far and wide. It is full of aspirations and doubts. One who bridles mind becomes happy here and hereafter.</p>

<p>When eye is joined to the mind, it sees all. When mind is confused, though the eye be open, one sees nothing.</p>
<!-- NpU = Nārada-parivrājhaka-upaniṣad — Ch. Dikshit, The Samnyasa Upanisads ... Adyar Library, 1929, p. 80 -->

<p>There is no difference between the feminine private organ and a festering wet wound. It is the male’s mind that makes the difference and takes him astray.</p>

<p>When it is termed saliva, men recoil. But when it is termed oral wine men crave for it. Men deceive themselves by terms that they have themselves fashioned.</p>

<p>Even though action does not vary, the mind makes the differentiation. The baby and the husband both suck the breast, but their thoughts are far apart.</p>

<p>A mendicant, a lover and a dog view a woman's corpse. They take different views. One considers her just a corpse, the other a beloved, the third as food.</p>
<!-- https://archive.org/details/SarngadharaPaddhati/page/n743/mode/2up -->

<p>It is the purity of sentiments that matters in all instances. The sentiment in kissing a wife is different from that in kissing a daughter.</p>

<p>Greed for other's goods brings joy neither here nor hereafter. People should seek joy by renouncing greed.</p>

<p>One should always hold an equanimous mind towards all creatures. One should neither be greedy nor envious. One should think neither incoherent nor unrealistic thoughts.</p>

<p>Control and restrain your senses and mind from engaging in prohibited, ignoble, unattainable and evil ends.</p>

<p>One who is envious of other’s wealth, beauty, power and birth, happiness, fortune and glory, his torment is unending.</p>

<p>This world belongs to men of forbearance. That world belongs to men of forbearance. Here they are adored, thereafter they attain beatitude.</p>

<p>For one who aspires to dominate there is nothing more glorious or healthier than forbearance.</p>

<p>If men of  earth-like forbearance be not present among the people, there would be no comradeship among them. Dissensions arise out of anger.</p>

<p>He who throws out excited anger with forgiveness, in the manner of a snake moulting his skin, he is known as the man.</p>

<p>Even if one were to continue killing till the end of his days, enemies would not be exhausted. But he, who knows how to control his anger, has no hater left.</p>

<p>O great king, drink in anger and be quiet. Anger is intense headache, not born of a malady, robbing glory, evil in its consequences, to be drunk in by the very noble ones and by none else.</p>

<p>The person, who has relinquished the rod and conquered his anger, who behaves towards others as if they were himself, herefater he flourishes in joy and comfort.</p>

<p>A person with enmity in his heart sleeps uneasily. His mind remains as troubled as if there were a snake in the house.</p>

<p>There is no sleep for one who is diseased, afraid, angry, worried about money, or for one who is in love.</p>

<p>One who does not get angry is superior to the angry ones. A tolerant person is superior to the intolerant. Men are superior to non-humans. And similarly a  learned one is superior to one without learning.</p>

<p>Whatever an angry person sacrifices, whatever he gives, whatever austerities he practises, whatever he pours into sacred fires, all that Vaivasvata robs away. The endeavours of an angry person become fruitless.</p>

<p>Penance is to be saved from anger, wealth from envy, learning from adulation and reviling, and one's self from negligence.</p>

<p>Anger is utter death. Avidity is the Vaitaraṇī river (hot, fetid, filled with blood and bones). Knowledge is the cow of the gods that grants all desires. Contentment is like lndra's grove Nandana.</p>

<p>Irritated and provoked one commits sins, one may even kill elders, and even attack sages and seers with harsh words.</p>

<p>An excited person does not know the distinction between what may or may not be uttered. There is nothing that he may not do or utter.</p>

<p>O best of kings, anger is an enemy which resides in the body of men. He, who renounces wrath and greed, becomes adorable.</p>

<p>Anger is to be specially controlled with regard to gods, kings, brāhmaṇas, children, aged and diseased.</p>

<p>To one who forgives and forbears for the sake of dharma and artha, śānti is the ultimate. And śānti is cultivated by patience.</p>

<p>Atheism, reviling the Vedas and divinities, envy, hypocrisy, pride, wrath and sharpness must be avoided.</p>

<p>Even though there be doubt about the existence of the other world, the wise ought to give up evil. In the case of non-existence nothing will happen, but in case the other world does exist, the atheist is undone.</p>

<p>The wise know that the other world has neither been seen before nor is it visible to the eyes now. One has to take it on faith and not overstep the scriptures.</p>

<p>Not accepting the authority of the Vedas, overstepping the śāstras, loss of faith all over—these lead to one's annihilation.</p>

<p>Be confident and put to your left (i.e. cast out) the atheist who has broken tradition, like the wind [the trees] on a river's bank. Cast him away just one would the upraised dust.</p>
<!-- argr: checked up to here on 2020-05-26 -->

<p>The atheists perform no rites. They transgress preceptors and scriptures. They hurt and injure. They misbehave. They lose their vital power.</p>
<!--ṇi-->

<p>The utter atheists seek the increase of what pertains to this world, e.g. flesh and blood. They are oblivious to such acts as pertain to the other world.</p>

<p>In this world one becomes great by performing two kinds of deeds–uttering nothing that is harsh, and not making requests to the low and vile.</p>

<p>Dreadful utterances burn out the vitals, the very bones, the hearts and even the life forces of men. Therefore one devoted to dharma must ever avoid harsh and hurting language.</p>

<p>One should not desire to abuse, speak what is false, or slander and gossip. If he is true and measured in speech, he protects and guards the wordy door.</p>

<p>Counting the virtues when face to face, but reviling when out of sight–such a one is like a cur, who loses the world.</p>

<p>Neither should one ever repeat or pronounce calumny. Either one should shut his ears or move on.</p>

<p>Foolish is he, who though prosperous does not help others, who though poor is generous, and who though ignorant is proud and swollen.</p>

<p>None is more foolish than the person who accuses others of faults which pertain to himself or who gets angry without having the power to remedy.</p>

<p>Evil men take soft speech as indication of weakness. The softness of gold (as tested on the touchstone) is regarded by the touchstone as its victory.</p>

<p>If the noble man asks a favour from the mean one, the latter begins to consider himself a superior person although everybody knows him to be otherwise.</p>

<p>The wise listen to the good and evil words of the prattling mass, and take up only what is good, like the swan which separates and takes milk out of water.</p>
