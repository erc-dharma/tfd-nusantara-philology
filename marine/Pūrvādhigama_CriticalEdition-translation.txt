	May there be no hindrance! As follows are the Precepts of the Pūrvādhigama which are essential extracts of the scriptures,[2] the primary knowledge for those [who have acquired the rank of] venerable teachers,[3] royal chaplains knowers of all sorts of virtues,[4] like the rays of the sun [in that] it removes the darkness in the hearts of all people,[5] the most precious crest jewel of all, placed atop the head by all the Śaiva teachers,[6] all of them: the lowest, the intermediate and the loftiest.[7]

And the Supreme guru [i.e. Śiva], his position (aṅgəh) is that of Great Bhagavan. His name is Paṅudaran Bhasma,[11] because he is entitled to be the one from whom ashes are received by the offspring and distant relations of those Bhasmāṅkura [ascetics].[12] Only He has power over the stability of the protection of the precepts [stated in the] Adhigama which are essential extracts of the scriptures for the benefit of all religious masters, all those who adhere to the scriptures of Śiva, specifically the Śaiva priests (bhujaṅga śiva) who are the elders in the capital; those who are consecrated [masters] (saṅ kr̥ta)[g]; even more so those who are about to [obtain a position] in the capital or in the districts; and most of all the class of judges who adjudicate in lawsuits, who are entitled to adjudicate the disputes of all people in the court as well as in the regions; such are their categories. Nevertheless (yayan), only the Adhigama Precepts, which are essential extracts of the scriptures, are means to express law-codes. The conditions of this whole [group] are. 
	nihan pratyeka saṅ bhujaṅga śivān pinakasthavira[13] riṅ nagara, saṅ kuməmit mamaṅku saṅ hyaṅ adhigamaśāsana śāstrasāroddhr̥ta, lvirnira, saṅ minakamapabhr̥ti[h],[14] saṅ ārya dharmādhyakṣa[i], lyan saṅke sira, vvalu kvehnya, ndya ta, saṅ ārya tirvan, saṅ ārya kaṇḍamuhi, saṅ ārya pamvatan, saṅ ārya pañjaṅ jīva, saṅ ārya maṅhuri, saṅ ārya jambi, saṅ ārya lekan, saṅ ārya taṅar,[15] ndah [j]samaṅkana lvirniṅ liṅgihnira, kapva bhujaṅga haji sira kabeh, yekā maṅharəp liṅgih riṅ nagara ṅaranira //
	As follows is the enumeration of the Śaiva priests who are the elders in the capital, who guard, protect, the Adhigama Precepts, which have been synthesized from the scriptures. Their categories are: 
- the one who is the first[k][l], the noble[m] administrator of religious law, [and] apart from him, eight is their number. Here they are:
- the noble one of Tiruan, the noble one of Kaṇḍamuhi, the noble one of Pamvatan, the noble one of Pañjaṅ Jīva, the noble one of Maṅhuri, the noble one of Jambi, the noble one of Lekan, the noble one of Taṅar. Now so many are the specifications of their ranks. All of them are peers as royal priests (bhujaṅga haji). They are the ones who have a claim[n] to a position at the capital.

	As follows are the characteristics of the consecrated priests (saṅ kr̥ta):[17] if there are priests who are venerable teachers, perfected in minor and major sciences; of consummate knowledge about instructions in precepts of oblation and in purification (consecration) through oblation, experts in All the Paths (sārvadhva);[18] authorized to practice, to take students who are priests, to prepare the implements for oblation,[19] [and] to take charge of the sacrificial fire; tirelessly carrying out the veneration ritual for Lord Śivāgni constantly,[20] visibly serving as spiritual teachers (and bestowers of holy water) for the people of the whole realm and all of the people from rural districts.[21] Priests whose conduct is such, they are called consecrated priests (kr̥tadīkṣita). As regards teachers, of any kind, if they are [confirmed] thus, they are called consecrated priests (saṅ kr̥ta), without discriminating with regard to their official position, whether their position[y] is in the capital, in the districts, or in the royal religious foundations, and so forth, nevertheless (regardless?), the accomplished ones will be considered consecrated priests.

	As follows are the characteristics of the judges: if there are teachers whose knowledge is perfect in all sciences, beginning with the dharma treatises, such as the Kuṭāra Mānava, etc, the Sārasamuccaya, Cāṇakya[’s treatise], and Kāmandaki[’s],[25] etc, whom are not confused by the difficulties of the “moving back and forth between” (inversions? intricacies? meanders?)[26] the different divisions, [namely] the explanations of the 18 points of litigation, the Aṣṭadaśavyavahāra, [on the one hand], and the popular usage (custom?), along with its teachings including the illustrative examples (udāharaṇa), [on the other hand]; [if] clear is their understanding of all of [the aforementioned], because of their omniscience in all sciences, those whose condition is such, they are called prāgivāka (judges/endowed with discernment), they are the adjudicators of lawsuits. In view of the fact that they have the right to decide all sorts of laws for the people, and [to] the disputes of people from all countries, that is the reason why they are considered as judges. Without discrimination is the condition of the prāgvivāka-judges, and (it is indifferent?) without discrimination is the social identity of those who are considered as judges, whether they are royal priests-bhujaṅga hajis, whether they are accomplished men of religion (saṅ kr̥ta), whether they officiate (maṅharĕp?, proceed, move forward, desire?) as dharmadhyākṣa or as interpreters of the law (dharmopapatti) in the districts and in the royal religious foundations, whether they are [people] of the auspicious time, let alone those who decide lawsuits in the various districts, i.e. in the five districts, in the residences of the adhipatis (rulers/kings/governors?), in the [administrative units] of the hulus and kuvus, and the sāmya, in the lineages (?), in the religious establishments, in the apanages, all of these deciders of lawsuits in these parts, even so they are all called prāgvivāka.

	And all of the royal priests, all of the consecrated priests, their condition is that they equally have the right to decide the laws of the people, with regard to them when [they are designated] with a single appellation, the ‘accomplished prāgvivāka’ - prāgvivākakr̥ta is what they are called, the kr̥taprāgvivāka is what they’re called[ae]. In brief, the accomplished ones are known to everybody[af] in the end, out of their being different from others, both of them are distinguished / put forward.

	Now the various categories of people known as judges (prāgivāka) and consecrated [priests] have been taught. After that it will be described / narrated about [the time] when all of them came to have the custody of the sacred Adhigamaśāsana, which has been extracted from (or synthesized as?) the essence of the scriptures, a privilege granted by the kings of the past, and their (his?) chief brahman, the Most excellent crest-jewel (agracūḍāmaṇi), the Supreme Guru, the Divine One, like the Lord of the Mountain [in that] he consists in — he is composed of the understanding / the experience of the flawless, they who completely give stability to the fixation of the rules for all the teachers who adhere to the Śaiva doctrine, the lowest, the intermediate and the loftiest.

	And this is the descent of the king’s [Narendra’s] grant[ak] to the old and wise kings, rulers of the past, having as distinctive mark the magically powerful words of the venerable teachers, royal chaplains, the supreme masters who are holy people. It, [as soon as it was] put together, it was received on the lap by all the royal teachers, whom all equally respectfully bowed [showing] the strength of their devotion to the Illustrious Supreme Guru [Śiva]. Because of their extreme joy at being granted this crest-jewel which was entirely of an imperishable nature - which has no end, such is the reason why they made no opposition in protecting the contents of the grant, and that they were not negligent in being the “amulets”[27] [al]for the protection of the Adhigama Rulings[am].

	As follows is the full contents of the Adhigamaśāsana (Adhigama Rulings),[as] which are essential extracts of the scriptures, the admonitions for the consecrated priests especially (or etc. ?). Pay attention!  all of you teachers, they are always to be remembered now in the present and in the future, even up to the distant future, in view of [maintaining] the stability of your[at] code of conduct[au]! Know that their rulings / precepts are distinct from those of the Rājaśāsana (“the śāsana of the kings”), and that [if] one keeps in mind one’s steadfast practice of each of them, without changing places[av], if one remains isolated (detached?) through his keeping of good conduct and of his established rules[aw], not interfered with by anything deviating from the holy tradition, knowing about the limits of the śāsana, not at all having two divisions with the Rājanīti (the royal policy) and Rājavidhi. Their own actions and that of king, they are not the support of one another, it would only be good that they would concentrate on the independent putting into practice of the Adhigamaśāsana, such are the actions of the consecrated priest who watches over the śāsana (precepts?). For their evils are wiped out / purified if they undergo the pasilih ceremony to substitute the conditions caused by their former actions. What kind of evil deeds? without fail the greatest misfortunes befall the ruler and the priest, if their respective way of action is that they are not extremely careful in protecting [the people/the law][ax], and all the more so if one or the other deviates [from the prescribed path], disturbing violently the Adhigamaśāsana, without doubt, those extremely evil [people], what[ay] is obtained by them is of the same weight as the whole Egg of Brahmā — [the whole world]. Without delay, it hits the worst evil-doers in the future as they reach [completion of] death. In brief, let the ruler as well as the consecrated priests be very careful, so that they be without impediments as they obtain auspicious varieties of karmic matters.

	 As follows are the prerogatives of the teachers who are consecrated bhujaṅga priests, including all of the Śaiva teachers coming after them, and also even their offspring and their distant relations in the future, down to the future’s future, here is their condition. As follows: there are the rājanīti [regulations on royal policy], the rājadaṇḍa [the penalties enforced by the king], the rājakārya [the royal festivals and obligatory service exacted by the king], and also the rājotpatti [tribute to the king], and the rājavidhi [regulations by which one pays taxes to people having the usufruct of said royal taxes (?)], the consecrated priests are exempted from such duties (?).

	The rājakāryas are any kinds of royal works/rituals/festivities, of great scale or small, of these types : being free from gatherings of large numbers of people to give contribution to a royal festivity (bvat haji), being free from being summoned (by “mobilisation?”), at public summons, from being what is given in custody, from being put to the side (??), [at] the time the ruler starts moving to attack the enemy, also if there are eight [of them?], if there are ten, they [can] disport themselves, or even go walking about. All of these which are called rājakāryas, the consecrated priests do not join in such works. Further, when it is the time when they are ten, or when they are eight (it being the eighth month?)[bb], they are walking about indeed, if they are invited or entrusted with a charge, it is possible for the consecrated priests to meet such wish. These are the sorts of royal works which will not fall down to the consecrated priests.

	The rājotpattis are any kinds of royal properties, revenue/tribute presented to the ruler, such as: the royal iron, the contribution to the flower offerings (ragasəkar), the revenues from the districts, the gardens, the rivers, the sea, the revenue from the markets (??), the revenue from the merchant(-vessels), from the gambling inspectors, from the kaləcan, the arrangement of the guild of merchants, all of these are called rājotpatti. The consecrated priests are exempted from such giving such tribute, in particular they [their lands?] are not “entered” by all of the beneficiaries of the royal share, all of those who are commanded by the ‘Three Lofty Ones’, [i.e.] the Paṅkur, the Tavan, and the Tirip, will not be conducted to the consecrated priests, as well as the piṅhay, the avaju, the vahuta officers, and the headmen (rāma), all of the people who are commanded by those do not penetrate the [land] of the consecrated priests.

	The rājavidhis are any kinds of royal subjects, among the lowest, the intermediate and the loftiest, and a favour has been agreed to by the ruler, that these subjects are granted the privilege to be authorised to enjoy the royal properties, [in the form of] a share of the usufruct from the king’s subjects. Here are the beneficiaries of the royal share known of old, the vuluvulus and other vulus great and minor, in the first place the miśras and paramiśras, the paṅuraṅs, the kriṅs, the paḍĕms,[31] the limus galuḥ, the maṅriñcis, the dhūras, the paṅaruhans, the paṅunĕṅans, the suṅgiṅs, the tajis, the vatu tajĕms, the sukuns, the halu varaks,[32] the piniṅles, the kataṅgarans, the tapa hajis, the air hajis, the malandaṅs (the inspectors of gambling?), the lĕcas, the lablabs, the paṅkuvaṅis, the kuṭaks, the taṅkils, the vatu valaṅs, the manigas, the pamanikans, the rumbans, the manambis, the siṅhirans, the tiṅkĕs’, the inspectors of ferries (manambaṅis), the [tuha] judis, the chiefs of the smiths (juru gosalis), the maṅrumbe, the juru huñjĕmans, the pavuruks, the pajukuṅs, the pavuṅ kunuṅs, the pakalaṅkaṅs, the pakaliṅkiṅs, the pavĕlaṅvĕlaṅs, the inspectors of horses (pakudas), the inspectors of elephants (palimans), the paguluṅans, the ḍampulans, the tĕpuṅ kavuṅ, the vĕli pañjut, the vĕli hapū, the miśra hino, the miśra aṅin-aṅin, the siṅgahs,  the pakatimaṅs, the kicakas, the vidu maṅiduṅs, the sumbals, the sumbuls, the royal servants who are part of the people attached to the kraton, and so forth.[33] Look, these are the people who are not allowed to set foot on [the land] of all the consecrated priests. Such [people] as precedes are called rājavidhi. 
Moreover such are the types of [provisions] included in the rājavidhi: the consecrated priests are exempted from worldly (customary?) duties. Lokikācāra means that the consecrated priests are exempted from compulsory contributions to the performance of royal ceremonies, of these categories: namely, the oblation of offerings, the ‘pushing’ of the chair (?), the material throne (?) / the material for the throne, the sacrifice[bh], the arik purih (land-)tax,[34]  the calaṅ caṅkiran tax (paid to the maṅilala dr̥vya haji), the pagoṭak, the pagoloṇḍoṅ, the padugaṅ and padugiṅ-taxes, the gañjar gifts, the pintan-pintan, the [tax?] on divisions (?). Such are the worldly (customary?) duties included in the rājavidhi, all of them do not touch the consecrated priests.

	Further, they are not subjected to the compulsory entertaining as royal servants, namely [being part of?] the corps of pages, being in the retinue of a prince, [serving] as his minor wives, also having prosperity, and all sorts of rare things kept for pleasure (means of diverting): dwarves, hunchbacks, people with short necks and long chests, sexually impotents (?), people with a skin-disease with white spots, albinos, dwarfish hunchbacks, dark-skinned people, slaves (Papuan?), let alone those who “are encouraged”, those who are picked and those who are watched [as they give performances?], the [wearers of] yellow garments, the vahuta officials, the spokesmen (?), the pralekis, the untal-untals, the three barats (soldiers?), and also the popoṇṭaṅ soldiers of the royal guard, the popoṅos, the troops of the West (?), the cacacucas, the kaluṅkuṅans, the kaluntaṅans, those who lie across (malaṅ) and “those who pass” (lumintaṅ), and also those who serve in the stables and the charioteers, those who are commissioned with the dogs, and so forth. The group of the accomplished ones are not subjected to such entertainments. Thus are the different types of royal regulations on people’s taxes.

	As follows is the rājanīti (‘the royal policy’): all of the things locked up for the king (reserved for him?) and forbidden, which are not possible to be approached by his subjects. The categories of royal “enclosed territory” are located in the Nītisavara [the Nītisāra?], the Adhigama, the pūrvadr̥ṣṭa (‘the norms of the past’), deśadr̥ṣṭa (‘the norms of the country’ or ‘customary law’), the śāstradr̥ṣṭa (‘the norms of the śāstra’). 
* Nītisavara is the procedure that is the result of having a beginning in the present, after it has been fixed in the audience-hall, 
* Adhigama is the procedure as found in the inscriptions,
* Pūrvadr̥ṣṭa is the adhigama and the regulations of the districts, which are the product of past cases and present, [such as they] are located in the places for audiences (papan?),
* Deśadr̥ṣṭa is the procedure [where] the regulations of the districts is put into practice, the results of those who had [worked] previously in the past are found, 
* Śāstradr̥ṣṭa is the procedure [where] the regulations of the districts go after the royal policy of the Precepts for the king (rājaśāsana),
All of these form what is called rājanīti, such lawcodes as these, it is not allowed that they apply to the group of the accomplished ones.

	As follows is [the description of] what is called the royal code of penalties (rājadaṇḍa), that is, the proclamation of the punishments and the faults that follow the essence of tradition of the Kuṭāra, the Mānava,[38] and other books. [Here is] the enumeration of the ways of punishments, there are the first (basic?) fine, the intermediary fine, the superior fine and the double superior fine.
* The primary fine is of 5000,
* The intermediary fine is of 10.000,
* The superior fine is of 20.000,
* The double superior fine is of 40.000,
Such are the categories of the royal code of penalties, which are directed at the young ones, continuously choosing the right thing, its course of action is to accompany [according to?] all sizes of faults.
 Moreover, the specificity of the royal code of penalties is that it does not have the right to hit the group of the accomplished ones. As for instance punishments by/and unjust punishments, reka, lūdan, tūtan, aṅśa pratyaṅśa (tax on parcelling out??), paraḍah fines/penalties, sipat rules, pressing/squeezing, insulting, beating, defamation, spitting, drawing sharp weapons, all of such punishments, it should not happen that they fall on the accomplished ones, for they are free from the use of violence, compensations [or understand valat vali?] and compulsory contributions to the performance of royal ceremonies, they will not be touched by the Rājaśāsana. But the dinaśrama will hit (apply to?) the group of the accomplished ones: dina means “good treatment - caring for” of those who are commissioned with [the application of] the royal code of penalties.

	śrama means the twelve divisions of the royal code of penalties. Their explanation:
* when [the fine] is of the double superior type, the falling of the rājadaṇḍa upon the immature one, [is] an effort / strain (śrama) for the community of r̥ṣis equivalent to 8000;
* when [the fine] is of the superior type, the falling of the disfavour upon the immature one, [is] an effort/ strain for the community of r̥ṣis equivalent to 4000;
* if [a fine] of the intermediary type falls upon the immature one, the effort/ strain for the community of r̥ṣis is equivalent to 2000;
* when a primary fine falls upon the immature one, the effort/ strain for the community of ascetics (r̥ṣis) is equivalent to 1000;
Here, likewise are the different types of śrama, which are well-known as the punishments for the community of ascetics (r̥ṣis), these should be used as examples (guidelines?) for the application of the various punishments for the communities of ascetic. Do not fail to use them with insight!

	Here is their explanation: if there is a follower of the accomplished ones, or also one of their offspring and distant relations who is of bad behaviour, [i.e] taking by force and/or abducting women, assaulting violently, setting fire (??) being an incendiary, engaging in any kind of criminal behaviour, taking a wife by violence (killing a man in order to take possession of his wife)[39], being a villain, 3 (?), they are called ekacorah (‘the supreme fellons’?), and also murderers (guilty of capital crimes?). The followers (dependants?) of the accomplished ones, when they are thus, they should be caused to disappear by all of their own priests (bhujaṅga). But if it is not within their reach to make [them] disappear, the people of evil conduct will be brought before the king, and the king will suppress [them], resulting in their death.
However, if these people of evil conduct implore [the king], begging to be spared their lives, consequently they are granted life because of the royal forgiveness. They will be severely hit with the punishment of evil people, [as] caturśaṭhapāṇa, [they owe] 8000. Such is their manner.

	As for the teachers who own people of evil conduct, if they ignore about the misconduct of their slaves, as also of their kinsmen and offspring of evil conduct, all the more so if they are at a distance from him, let these owners of evil men not be touched/troubled at all by the king. However, if they are aware of the misconduct of their slaves, and also of their offspring, without making it known to the public (vvaṅ makveh?), they will be hit with the punishment of a paraḍah fine by those who are already accepted at their rank, a total sum of 1600. Likewise is the paraḍah fine for those who own people of evil conduct.

Indeed, what the consecrated ones should do in case they are sought out for refuge by such people of bad behaviour is like that: they should be asked by them to go away from / to escape from the abode of the consecrated ones. If this evil-doer who is taking refuge with him is not willing to depart, it will be made known to the king without delay, with the result that his name (?) will be seen by the people.

________________
[1] Note the variety of the opening formulas in the different manuscripts. On the fluidity of such formulas, see Nattier 2003: 26-27.
[2] Compare with other occurrences of śāsana in the same text (; §8 saṅ hyaṅ śāsanādhigama; §9 svatantra saṅ hyaṅ śāsanādhigama). Note that sāroddhr̥ta is probably a synonym of sāroddhāra, which itself is a synonym for paddhati, a manual built around a series of citations quoted from a main scripture. Therefore the compound -sāroddhr̥ta, a cliché often found in Old-Javanese literature (Acri 2018: xxx), is indicative of the technical genre of literature this work belongs to. In translating śāstra as ‘scriptures’, I follow A. Sanderson’s remarks according to which the normal sense to be given to śāstra in Śaiva works is ‘scriptures’, i.e. the Śivaśāstra. Conversely, it is rather in Buddhist usage that śāstra denotes works of scholarship (2003: 353-354). 
[3] Friederich interpreted this sentence quite differently: “het eerst vervaardigd door den voleindigden ouder[by][bz] leraar”, i.e. ‘the first to be composed by the perfected old scholar’ (1849: 25-26).
[4] sarvaguṇajña could also be understood in a more technical sense, in the light of the theory of the three guṇas, sattva, rajas and tamas, usually referred to collectively as ‘the three constituents’ (Acri 2011: 408). These triguṇas are defined in the most important Śaiva tattvas, such as the Vr̥haspatitattva, Dharmapātañjala and the Tattvajñāna.
[5] Friederich’s reading of this Sanskrit compound (ibid) fails to recognise the word tamisra, ‘darkness, darkness of the soul’. He splits the words differently, and seems to arrive at the conclusion that the particle ta separates the alleged name of the Pūrvādhigama’s author, Miśraharaṇa [sic], from his epithets. I would rather take this compound as an epithet qualifying not the author of the text, but the text itself and its enlightening virtues.
[6] The action of receiving a sacred order from above, usually from a king, and placing it atop one’s head like one’s crest jewel is well known from Sanskrit epigraphy from all over the Indic world (Francis?: ). In this case, this royal imagery is transposed in a purely religious sphere: the god’s words are received and held as the highest command by the Śaiva teachers. 
[7] See the translation given by H. Creese (2009: 257), “This is the first and most excellent āgama, containing the essence of the books of learning and of the ancient knowledge that flows eternally (pūrvādhigama śāsana sarodṛtha śāstra pūrvārambah) from those who are learned scholars (vṛddhācārya), and chief priests of the court (rājapurohita). It incorporates the laws for the conduct of all.”, which seems somewhat loose and does not completely take into account the Sanskrit compounds.
[8] This form is not recorded in OJED, but it is attested with the same meaning in the Saṅ Hyaṅ Pamutus (Buddhist). See prov. ed.+transl. AG: ya ta mapisan riṅ pramāṇa, ka, pramāṇa [fol5v] mary *amramāṇakĕn “They unite in authority (pramāṇa). The meaning is that the authority ceases to have any authority”.
[9] Use of the word sthavira in a Śaivite context, showing the influence of a Buddhist worldview? see other 
[10] I follow the reading in ms. BG (L881).
[11] I translate paṅudaran as ‘holy man’, following the suggestions of the KBW, which derives it from udāra II, ‘high, lofty, great, noble, illustrious’. See OJED 2099.7.
[12] Csaba Kiss has gathered some data from Sanskrit texts (Śaiva paddhatis and jātiviveka) about this little-known Śaiva category of persons called bhasmāṅkura. His conclusions are that this appellation is an original Śaiva category, a product of the Śaiva age, used to classify people characterised by their problematic or sinful origins, who are thereby prohibited from being consecrated as ācāryas (Kiss forthcoming). In medieval Java, it would appear that this group was held in a much less demeaning regard. See other occurrences of bhasmāṅkura in Sum. 59.3, tan hāvan gati sārarāhavu havū vvaṅ ahayu tinuras rarasnikā / lūd bhasmāṅkura laṇḍa rakva sira saṅ tuhatuhanika yan sakeṅ bibi, wherein we understand from the context that one of the duties of this ascetic is to prepare the ash powder. In connection with the specific rule by which these bhasmāṅkura ascetics abided, as distinct from those of the other sects, see also Sum. 128.1, vetvetniṅ brāhmaṇātyanta vĕkasiṅ aruhur kadvijāṅśan ginöṅnya / vetniṅ śaivarṣy aluṅgvīnĕhĕr amuji kabhasmāṅkuran mūlya denya / vetniṅ boddhādvitīyan rumĕjarĕja kabuddhāṅkuran kāraṇanya (“Descendants of Brahmins enjoyed the highest status since they clung to their status as Brahmins assiduously. The descendants of Śaiva sages sat next in order for their status as descendants of non-Brahmin priests was high. The descendants of Buddhist priests, who were without equal, held their status in high regard because of their rank as Buddhists”), as well as SwS 3h1b17.
[13] Provisionally I emend pinakasthavira, even though all the manuscripts have initial m and a long ā. See other occurrences, spelt pinakāsthavira, in the Sugih Manek inscription, from 837 Śaka (saṅ pārtha pinakāsthavira i pakāraṇān), and Mpu Hasthavīra in the Kāñcana inscription (mapakna mpu sthāpaka‚ təmpah‚ 2, iṅ gayanti uṅgvanya, mpu brahmā ta sthāpaka, mpu hasthavīra).
[14] All mss. have minaka-. Emend? Or is this an idiosyncrasy of late texts?
[15] Very similar lists of functionaries, apparently serving as judges, appear in the inscriptions of the Majapahit period, albeit epigraphical lists amount to seven people in their complete form instead of eight here. In these inscriptions (Tuhanyaru, Canggu, Sidateka, Bendasari, Sekar[bt][bu]), they are called samgət or pamgət and they are associated with the same series of toponyms. See also Deś. 83.2c-d for a reference to the seven upapatti, followed by these three: pañjyaṅ jīva, lekan, taṅar, apparently minor ritual specialists. It appears quite logical that the two samgət i kaṇḍaṅan (atuha and rare), the last two of the standard list, are not represented in the Pūrvādhigama as they seem to belong to the Buddhist congregation. See van Naerssen 1933, 1941. 
[16] We would expect para saṅ, see if there are other occurrences of this word order.
[17] The term saṅ kr̥ta, ubiquitous in this text, seems to have acquired a polysemic value originating in the use of a Sanskrit derived form saṁskr̥ta (‘consecrated, sanctified, initiated’) in the archipelagic context. saṅ is indeed a typical Old Javanese honorific particle, making it easy for the locutors of this language to split saṁskr̥ta as saṅ skr̥ta and then subsequently saṅ kr̥ta. This term saṁskr̥ta is basically synonymous with kr̥tadikṣīta, which is one of the defining characteristics of the group of priests whose qualifications are described in this sub-section. In usage however, at least in this text, the two do not seem interchangeable, saṅ kr̥ta being much more common than kr̥tadikṣīta. It appears that saṅ kr̥ta has taken on a more general meaning through time, ‘the perfected ones’, referring to a category of priests of a prominent status, whose dominant position in the hierarchy of their order is guaranteed partly by their initiation, but also by their specialized knowledge and capacity to perform certain sacrifices. 
[18] Is this sarvādhva a reference to the doctrine of the adhvans, or ṣaḍadhvan, the sixfold division of the cosmos into paths (bhuvanas, kālas, tattvas, varṇas, padas and mantras), which is known from the Svāyaṁbhuvasūtrasaṁgraha (an early text of the Siddhānta stream, see Goodall 1998)? A verse from this text (SBSS, 6d) indeed mentions the six paths by the term sarvādhva°. Acri has noted that a parallel to this passage exists in the Vr̥haspatitattva 7-10, wherein the redactor seems to have changed sarvādhva for the more general sarvataḥ, either because of a misunderstanding or of his lack of familiarity with this doctrine (2006: 121-122). 
[19] This is the translation for pahoma, but we should consider the possible emendation to pahoman, the place for oblation.
[20] Supposing that satata might alternatively mean the same as nitya, one might translate: ‘carrying out the regular (satata, i.e. nitya) veneration of Lord Śivāgni’? See other examples in the Bhuvanakośa where we translated xxx as nitya, assuming that in this context a regular Śaiva observance is referred to. D. Goodall says that in South Asian texts, such a usage of satata would not occur.
[21] Translate as a dvāndva les districts ruraux et frontières, les gens des confins des districts ruraux.
[22] em. prāgvivāka or keep prāgivāka? It would make more sense to consider that the function is intended here rather than the virtue of being endowed with discernment or judicious[bv].
[23] See parallel passage in the Tantri Dəmuṅ (4.44a): tan vruh iṅoṅ rusitniṅ saṅ amatut bĕlahan iṅ aṣṭadasavyavara.
[24] The form paməgatan is not attested in OJED.
[25] While Cāṇakya is none other than the famous figure to whom the Arthaśāstra is attributed, Kāmandaki is the author of a core nītiśāstra text, the Nītisara, composed at the advent of the early medieval (Creese 2009: 244; Singh 2010)[bw]. Claiming a sound knowledge of similar series of authoritative texts seems to have been a topos in praises of Javanese scholars, since the 12th century at least. See for instance a passage of the Smaradahana (1.17), where Br̥haspati is qualified as vruḥ iṅ śāstra kuṭāramantra ṅuniveḥ cārakya [=cāṇakya] kāmandaka, ‘knowledgeable in the treatises of the Kuṭāramantra [type] and especially those of Cāṇakya and Kāmandaki’. Note that the Pūrvādhigama inserts a fourth text in the Smaradahana’s series, i.e. the Sārasamuccaya. [bx]
[26] Comment the use of kavalik, when the intended meaning seems rather to have been avalikan. Potential corruption here in the transmission? 
[27] MW 672: “pratisara (m,f,n): a cord or ribbon used as an amulet worn round the neck or wrist at nuptials, a bracelet, a line returning into itself, circle, assailing, an attack, the name of particular magical verses or formulas protecting from demons.” Hidas points out that the use of pratisara in the masculine gender can be traced back to Brahmanism and texts such as the Atharva-Veda (2012: 22, n.6, 7). This term appears in numerous later Hindu texts as well, for reference see Ślaczka 2007: 68-69; the entry pratisara in Goodall and Rastelli. See also Cruijsen, Griffiths & Klokke 2012 for pratisarā. In the Arjunavivāha, the term pratisāra appears in this context: ṅkāna ta (var. saṅkaṭa) saṅkananiṅ mamĕgat-mĕgati pratisāra, “A stronghold from which they would be able to cut off their best troops”, in Robson’s translation. 
[28] A similar wording is found passim in curses invoked from the gods in the inscriptions. For example, see OJO LXXI, 1181 ce, (pəpədakən prāṇāntika), LXXXII, 1323 ce, (pəpədakən vəkas i prāṇāntika), LII, s.a., (təhər pəpədakən vəkasan prāṇāntika). 
[29] It is very tempting to draw a parallel between these manambis and the tuha nambis, ‘chiefs of the nambis’, which are usually mentioned at about the same point in the standard list of maṅilala dr̥vya haji of the Majapahit period.
[30] Zoetmulder emends valigara, but van der Tuuk suggests valighāra (‘the besprinkling of offerings’), which indeed corresponds with the reading from ms. BG. Check other instances, it seems that van der Tuuk indeed has used ms. BG for his abstracts in KWB.
[31] OJED, s.v. paḍĕm III, suggests ‘head of the fire department’ with a question mark, given the frequent association of this function with the term apuy, ‘fire’.
[32] Zoetmulder draws a possible connection with luvarak, ‘chief musician’ (OJED 1069)?
[33] Such lists of maṅilala dr̥vya haji are quite strictly standardized and seem to follow the same model from the earliest inscriptions onwards. However, it is worth observing that the list given here contains almost all the elements found in lists of the Majapahit period. Some seven or eight terms found in the inscriptions of Tuhanyaru and Geneng II are missing here, but conversely, the list given in this text contains only one or two elements absent from the standard list in the Majapahit period.
[34] See three inscriptions from the last decades of the 14th century (Biluluk, Trawulan V, and CSt 4), probably all part of the group of short regional inscriptions, where different people are exempted from such arik purih taxes. 
[35] but see van der Tuuk’s KBW s.v. praleki, napraleni.
[36] See OJED 2151, which refers back to OJED 2130, s.v. upadita. Indeed the Sanskrit meaning utpādita, ‘produced, effected, generated’ seems to me more difficult to connect with the rest of this clause.
[37] I find the boundary marker // seems rather out of place here, as it occurs in the middle of the explanation of the syntagm dināśrama. 
[38] Check where T. Lubin distinguishes between these two works, which he describes as a composite tradition (2015: 254). 
[39] See Ślokāntara 32. 4, dārātikrama ṅaranya vvaṅ ambahud aṅris, “dārātikrama is said of a man who kills someone in order to take possession of his wife.”, as well as Ślokāntara 33.8, which defines the six forms of murder (ṣaḍātatāyi). Whereas the term ṣaḍātatāyi is not mentioned here, maybe check if the enumeration of crimes listed here tally with the list in the Ślokāntara: agnida, viṣada, atharwa, śastraghna, dārātikrama, rājapiśuna. It does not seem so though.
[40] OJED (1982.5) suggests this meaning for maliṅ tələs, but see also, further down, the gloss given by the Pūrvādhigama itself over paṇḍuṅ tĕlĕs. 
[41] This “they” in all probability refers to the kr̥ta, the consecrated ones, rather than to the durācāra.
