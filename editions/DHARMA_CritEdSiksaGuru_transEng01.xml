     <div n="1" corresp="#siksaguru_01">
  <p n="1" corresp="#siksaguru_01.01">I will first teach the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign> as follows. You will succeed in listening to the discussion of the holy <foreign>dharma</foreign> and the determined state of the holy gnosis. There is what is called the pure circle of three bodily domains*, uttered by the teacher to the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>. That is possibly the action, speech, and mind. If there is a feeling of loss in your heart*,it is them that should be practiced and restrained. You should just guard them and fix them, for they are the causes of finding joy and sorrow, good and bad.</p>
       
       <p n="2" corresp="#siksaguru_01.02">If your action, your speech and your mind are unrighteous, in that case you surely obtain the wrong. If your action, your speech, your heart are righteous, in that case it is clear that you obtain the virtue. That is why there is a proverb “Thus one repeatedly baths, the water is touched by the original nature of the human: bad meets its bad, good meets its good”*. Likewise is human nature.</p>
       
       <p n="3" corresp="#siksaguru_01.03">What are the illustrations with regard to the consequence of this, <supplied reason="subaudible">namely</supplied>: bad from its bad, good from its good? As follows is your analogy*: there is what is called the priceless jewel, its value can not be known, being incomparable* in terms of beauty. The meaning is: the priceless jewel and the most coveted jewel. Is it fitting to be bound to bell-metal, copper, and tin by you? What is the appropriateness <supplied reason="subaudible">of such a condition</supplied>? It is evident that if its splendor and its shine come out, then your binding for the priceless jewel and your tieing for the most coveted gem in such a manner are appropriate.</p>
       
       <p n="4" corresp="#siksaguru_01.04">As follow is the word of the holy treatise: <q><foreign>ləpas ca vuṅkunuṅ ceva, adhika udika tatte tatur tathya tuṅgəṅ, tad eva nigaḍyate</foreign>.</q>* Because what is considered loose hair is square hair (? <foreign>vulu pasagi</foreign>); there is the <foreign>uḍika</foreign>, the <foreign>tater</foreign>, and the lice*. Are all of them appropriate to be bound to the priceless jewel and chained to the most coveted jewel? No, it is not like that; they should be bound to the bell-metal, copper, and tin. Why is that appropriate? The binding to the priceless jewel, the chaining to the most coveted jewel, such is the word of the holy treatise: <q><foreign>ləpas ca vuṅkunuṅ ceva, adhika udika tatte tatur tathya tuṅgəṅ nu yvagyanika</foreign></q>.</p>
       
       <p n="5" corresp="#siksaguru_01.05">There is what is called the glowing gold*, beautiful gold; its value is one <foreign>kati</foreign>. The course of action* will be <supplied reason="subaudible">as follows</supplied>: it is mixed seven times seven <supplied reason="subaudible">times</supplied>*, transforming into the weight of one <foreign>tahil</foreign> of stone. How can it be strong, not undulating, unwavering, when it is set ablaze again? For only in this way is the best quality of all the gold, and then your binding of priceless jewels and your tying of the most coveted jewel are appropriate and good.</p>
       <p n="6" corresp="#siksaguru_01.06">It <supplied reason="subaudible">i.e. gold</supplied> is bound with bell-metal, copper, and tin, its splendor and its shine are not coming out. What are the reasons why they are not appropriate? Wrong innate <supplied reason="subaudible">disposition</supplied>, wrong karma, wrong nature. Just so is the holy supreme <foreign>dharma</foreign>*: it is a priceless gem. And also your body: it is the most coveted gem.</p>
       
       <p n="7" corresp="#siksaguru_01.07">Here is the analogy of bell-metal, copper, and tin: they are not appropriate to be bound to the priceless jewel, <supplied reason="subaudible">and be</supplied> tied by you to the most coveted jewel.</p> 
       
       <p n="8" corresp="#siksaguru_01.08">They are as follows: bad actions, improper speech, and impure minds towards all humans — especially toward scholars. The meaning is: bad actions, improper speech, and a dirty mind are really not appropriate; the holy <foreign>dharma</foreign> shall be reflected upon; furthermore, protect <supplied reason="subaudible">it</supplied> in your body*, and even more so with respect to holy men*. No, it is not proper <supplied reason="subaudible">to have improper speech, etc.</supplied>: repeatedly your birth <supplied reason="subaudible">arises</supplied>; one stops to desire having a child, having a wife, building a family, having relatives and a mother in law. He is unable to protect <supplied reason="subaudible">himself</supplied> from bad actions, improper speech, a bad mind towards all humans, and especially towards ascetics. How would your protection of your body be appropriate? That is ‘the glowing’ (<foreign>santaṅva</foreign>) according to the scholar. It means the glowing gold: the good action, the good speech, the good heart. Those should be protected by <supplied reason="subaudible">means of</supplied> the holy <foreign>dharma</foreign>.</p>
       
       <p n="9" corresp="#siksaguru_01.09">As follows is the reason why it is called the pure circle of three bodily domains, according to the scholar: tri means three. The circle of three bodily domains is pure*. So it is said. Thus are the three bodily domains, according to the scholar.</p> 
       
       <p n="10" corresp="#siksaguru_01.10">As follows is the beginning* of the affection of a scholar toward the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>. It is pure in good thought. Do it quickly! Do not be tucked in with dirty thoughts. The heart and mind are pure. Then, purify the mind and the set of your emotions! You should be aware when thinking; you should practice the activity of begging for alms (<foreign>bhikṣā-lakṣanam</foreign>)* with full attention.</p>
       <p n="11" corresp="#siksaguru_01.11">Here are your characteristics, O holy man. Do not just be attached to servants. It is evident when the hair has been cut. Cut it <supplied reason="subaudible">so that</supplied> there is no obstruction or hindrance. That is the purity (<foreign>pariśuddha</foreign>): you should cut it before and you should control it. It is what is called †<foreign>r̥kr̥t</foreign>† gold, and making flower offerings with water*. In this manner you serve the scholar. Do not commit the sin of violating the guru’s bed (<foreign>guru-talpaka</foreign>)*, <supplied reason="subaudible">which is</supplied> a misfortune for the world; <supplied reason="subaudible">rather, you</supplied> should fear him. You should be devoted and submit to the teacher, you should carry out <supplied reason="subaudible">acts of</supplied> extreme respect toward the teacher, including scholars. <supplied reason="subaudible">In this manner you</supplied> come to the realization of that goal.</p>
       <p n="12" corresp="#siksaguru_01.12">In this manner you are the servant of the scholar, and even more so of the king. Do not be unfaithful toward the king. <supplied reason="subaudible">You</supplied> will be fined and hated. You should be afraid of him, so that you will not be sold and die horribly. You should be loyal to the king: that is why <supplied reason="subaudible">you</supplied> come to the realization of that goal (i.e., avoiding being sold and dying). You* elder (<foreign>rāma</foreign>), <foreign>kalaṅ</foreign>, <foreign>gusti</foreign>, vizir (<foreign>patih</foreign>) in the village (<foreign>banva</foreign>), <supplied reason="subaudible">should behave</supplied> in this manner. Furthermore, <supplied reason="subaudible">concerning</supplied> the quality (<foreign>dharma</foreign>) of a balanced mind in people like you, you should not have an unbalanced voice* in the legal proceeding, do not lean left and right with respect to good and bad qualities. It is not appropriate <supplied reason="subaudible">as the</supplied> behavior of an experienced man, says the holy scriptures. That <supplied reason="subaudible">wrong behavior</supplied> should not be followed by you, that is the reason why <supplied reason="subaudible">if you follow it</supplied> the three domains of body and mind (<foreign>trikāya maṇḍalam cittam</foreign>) are not achieved. Then the servants of the <foreign>dharma</foreign> should devote their full attention to what is called ‘the sacred circle of the three pure bodily domains’. It is the beginning of the affection of the scholar toward the servants of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>.</p>
     </div>
     
     <div n="2" corresp="#siksaguru_02">
       <p n="1" corresp="#siksaguru_02.01">There is a second <supplied reason="subaudible">type of</supplied> affection of the scholar toward the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>, which is called the ten rules (<foreign>daśa-śīla</foreign>)*. They are the following: ears, eyes, nose, tongue, mouth, skin, hands, genitals, anus, legs. This* is what the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign> should hear.</p>
       <p n="2" corresp="#siksaguru_02.02"><foreign>Śrotra</foreign> means ears. What is the sphere of the ears? They serve as a gate to hear the bad and good words. When you hear sweet and fragrant words, your heart becomes comfortable. When you hear a bad word, its fault is evidently unthinkable. Please do not repeat it. A good action for the teacher, that is what the servants of the <foreign>dharma</foreign> who are deaf* in hearing the scriptures of the hermit should endeavor to carry out.</p>
       <p n="3" corresp="#siksaguru_02.03"><foreign>Cakṣuh</foreign> means eyes. What is the sphere of activity of the eyes? To see good and bad, which causes joy and sorrow. How could they (i.e., the eyes) cause joy? They serve as your instrument to see the good deeds. You are without hindrance* by means of that. How could that bring sorrow? From them (the eyes, <foreign>saka rika</foreign>), you should see the gold* of the other fellow human beings. You walk to a public place, you see people with disabilities, leprosy, invalidities, goiter, <supplied reason="subaudible">a stomach affected by</supplied> starvation (? <foreign>buḍaya</foreign>)*, defolded*, stiff and rigid <supplied reason="subaudible">limbs</supplied>*, all kinds of frightening appearance* that exist in humans, let alone those who are blind and deaf of the eyes and ears. Furthermore, do not hurt somebody who has disable bodies*. You should not be like that. It is called avoiding strong emotion (<foreign>caṇḍa-parihāra</foreign>)*, for the innate nature and karma* are not seen. Also, people hurt because of it, that is what the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign> should pay attention to.</p>
       <p n="4" corresp="#siksaguru_02.04"><foreign>Grhāṇa</foreign> means nose. What is the sphere of activity of the nose? It serves as an instrument to smell fragrant scents (<foreign>surabhi</foreign>), bad smell (<foreign>asurabhi</foreign>), <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> extraordinary smell (<foreign>asādhāraṇa</foreign>)*. <foreign>Surabhi</foreign> means fragrant, <foreign>asurabhi</foreign> means stinky and musty <supplied reason="subaudible">odor</supplied>, <foreign>asadhāraṇa</foreign> means singed smell (<foreign>haṅit</foreign>)*. Therefore, the kinds of smells are three. When you smell the fragrance, your heart is happy; when you smell a stinky and musty <supplied reason="subaudible">odor</supplied>, your heart is not happy, then* your anger appears; that is the cause for the inappropriate speech to arise. The three bodily domains of ultimate truth (<foreign>trikāya paramārtha</foreign>)* are not experienced. That is the reason why the sphere of the nose must be properly paid attention to and seriously cared after by the servants of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>.</p>
       <p n="5" corresp="#siksaguru_02.05"><foreign>Jihvā</foreign> means tongue. What is the sphere of activity of the tongue? It serves as an instrument of tasting* the six flavors, namely: salty (<foreign>lavaṇa</foreign>), spicy (<foreign>kaṭuka</foreign>), bitter (<foreign>tikta</foreign>), sour (<foreign>amla</foreign>), savory (<foreign>kaṣāya</foreign>)*, sweet (<foreign>madhura</foreign>). These are called the six flavors (<foreign>ṣaḍrasa</foreign>). <foreign>Lavaṇa</foreign> means salty, <foreign>kaṭuka</foreign> is spicy*, <foreign>tikta</foreign> bitter, <foreign>amla</foreign> sour, <foreign>kaṣāya</foreign> savory, <foreign>madhura</foreign> sweet. Those are called the six flavors (<foreign>ṣaḍrasa</foreign>). Furthermore, they are all enjoyed by you; you will be oblivious of everything but becoming sick because of them. You shall not do so. Its object (i.e. the tongue) becomes a goal to be realized. That is a sign that you will abandon good works toward the teacher. If so, then the pure circle of three bodily domains is not experienced.</p> 
        <p n="6" corresp="#siksaguru_02.06"><foreign>Vāk</foreign> means words*. What is the sphere of activity of the words? Not every word should be followed by you: harsh words <supplied reason="subaudible">equal</supplied> aggressive behavior*. In the situation of powerlessness and in trouble, you do not make other human beings feel at ease. However, what you should speak are words that are sweet, gentle, <supplied reason="subaudible">with</supplied> an agreeable <supplied reason="subaudible">facial</supplied> gesture. All kinds of things that make them indifferent to the world, and which are heard in succession by human beings*, that is how you guard your words.</p>
       <p n="7" corresp="#siksaguru_02.07"><foreign>Tvak</foreign> means skin. What is the sphere of activity of the skin? To feel and experience heat and cold. The point of this is the effort to restrain the passions* that emerge from the skin.</p>
       <p n="8" corresp="#siksaguru_02.08"><foreign>Pāṇi</foreign> means hand. What is the sphere of activity of the hand? To join the fingers of the hand*, to join <supplied reason="subaudible">the hands</supplied> when talking to the teacher. Also not to join the hands together with the teacher, and especially not to point the hand toward the face of the teacher; when the food of the teacher should be grasped, it should not be touched with the mouth*. Or, do not take the teacher’s divine-property (<foreign>drabya hyaṅ</foreign>), let alone of any <supplied reason="subaudible">kind of</supplied> people. This means do not be disloyal* if he has a request. There are “sword leaves”* in the sacred texts of the hermit. Such is what you should do to guard your hands.</p>
       <p n="9" corresp="#siksaguru_02.09"><foreign>Pāyu</foreign> means anus. What is the sphere of activity of the anus? It is circular (<foreign>utər</foreign>) and joint (<foreign>saṅga</foreign>). Defecating <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> farting <supplied reason="subaudible">as appropriate</supplied> are the ways in which you guard the anus. You should not fart in front of the teacher of men, you should not be in front of people when you defecate. <supplied reason="subaudible">These behaviors</supplied> are not ordered by the teacher, and by all the religious wanderers (<foreign>paramābhyāgata</foreign>)*. Such are the ways in which you should guard your anus.</p>
       <p n="10" corresp="#siksaguru_02.10"><foreign>Upastha</foreign> means sexual organ. What is the sphere of activity of the sexual organ? To feel sexual pleasure <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> to urinate. The meaning is as follows: to urinate, it should not be done in front of the people, especially those of high birth: male, female, servant, noble man, low, medium, and high. Since its <foreign>maruruca</foreign> (?) is great, the sins of becoming a human being comes out. What is considered as its sins? You see a man that is sold. His sins are his <supplied reason="subaudible">way of</supplied> seizing women: misbehaving toward friends, misbehaving toward the teachers, taking by force forbidden women. The body vehemently becomes dirty if it is as such. <supplied reason="subaudible">That</supplied> must be paid attention to by the servants of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>.</p>
       <p n="11" corresp="#siksaguru_02.11"><foreign>Pāda</foreign> means the feet. What is the sphere of activity of the feet? To walk wherever is your destination, whether you go to the north, south, west, east, or to sit in a sila position. Then the way to guard the foot is: not kicking, not assuming an impolite posture*, not <supplied reason="subaudible">assuming</supplied> an unstable posture*, not to lean sideways, not to lie stretched out, not sit by dangling* the leg in front of the teacher, <supplied reason="subaudible">or</supplied> of all religious wanderers. This <supplied reason="subaudible">is the way</supplied> to guard the foot, <supplied reason="subaudible">which</supplied> should be made the object of full attention by the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>.</p>
     </div>
     
<div n="3" corresp="#siksaguru_03">
      <p n="1" corresp="#siksaguru_03.01">As follows is the third affection of the scholar to the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>. Here are the five instructions, as they are called, namely:</p>
  <p rend="stanza" corresp="#siksaguru_03.02">Non-anger, obedience to the teacher, purity, moderation in food, and non-inattentiveness are the five known as particular commandments.</p>
  <p n="2" corresp="#siksaguru_03.03">Non-anger (<foreign>akrodho</foreign>) means: it doesn't happen that a servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign> shows his anger in front of the teacher, let alone to all good men. Obedience to the teacher (<foreign>guruśuśruṣā</foreign>) means that you are devoted and obedient to the teacher, never far from the feet of the elders. <supplied reason="subaudible">It should be</supplied> that way if there is an order from the teacher. Furthermore, <supplied reason="subaudible">you should be</supplied> completely pure: the highest reality of three bodily domains should be made the object of your attention, that is good act, good speech, good thought. The pure circle of three bodily domains, together with the ten rules and the five instructions should be made the object of your efforts whether <supplied reason="subaudible">you are</supplied> far or near. Thus is called the obedience to the master. Purity (<foreign>śauca</foreign>) is to clean your hand* when you hold the food of the teacher, let alone the properties of the scholar. Moderation in food (<foreign>āhāralāghava</foreign>) <supplied reason="subaudible">means</supplied> you are swift <supplied reason="subaudible">while</supplied> eating; <supplied reason="subaudible">however, if</supplied> the balls of rice are big, and <supplied reason="subaudible">your</supplied> eating quickly is uncontrolled*, don’t <supplied reason="subaudible">act</supplied> like that! That is called the belly palace (<foreign>kukṣi-pura</foreign>)*. How could <supplied reason="subaudible">that</supplied> be the way of eating? It is only the vital breath with control (<foreign>prāṇa sadhāraṇa</foreign>) the daily means of subsistence of one who thinks about the Holy Good. These are what are called the five instructions, which should be made the object of attention by the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>.</p>

         <p n="1" corresp="#siksaguru_04.01">As follows is the fourth affection of the scholar to the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>. This is what is called the instruction of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>, here it is—the śloka about it is as follow:</p> 
         <p rend="stanza" corresp="#siksaguru_04.02">Writing, laughing, singing, yawning, and pure <supplied reason="subaudible">from</supplied> the secret of fruit (?), one shall not do in front of the teacher.</p>
         <p n="2" corresp="#siksaguru_04.03">The meaning is <supplied reason="subaudible">as follows</supplied>; <foreign>ālekhyam</foreign>* means: do not write on the soil, do not write on the board, let alone on your body, when you serve the teacher, because there are those who are considered men with good characteristics, <supplied reason="subaudible">but</supplied> constantly writing their thighs when talking with the teacher; <foreign>hasitam</foreign>*: not to laugh in the front of the teacher, let alone to make a joke; <foreign>gītam</foreign>: not to sing—the manner of not claiming expertise*, if it is not ordered by the teacher; <foreign>jr̥mbhanam</foreign>*: not to express hunger <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> satiety in the front of the teacher; <foreign>kaṇṭhāravam</foreign>*: not to yawn; †<foreign>akadanǝm</foreign>† do not stretch a body <supplied reason="subaudible">and emit sounds</supplied>* in front of the teacher; <foreign>śuddham phalarahasyam</foreign>: not to talk in a selfish manner in the front of the teacher, let alone to pronounce the name “penis”; it is forbidden <supplied reason="subaudible">to do</supplied> so.

That is the reason why one obtains the holy doctrine of the jewel (<foreign>ratnopadeśa</foreign>) originating from the reverend elders. There are what are called the three pacified bodily acts. You should be striving for them and should really pay attention to them*, for those are the origin of the bad and good, joy and sorrow of the current human life. You see people who are killed, beheaded; their father and mother are plundered and sold, their relatives are enslaved, their fathers are dragged into fields. What is the reason for this? The lack of diligence in practicing the holy three pacified bodily acts. The meaning is: without practicing it, they obtained sin and great misery. If you would speak like this: “Just in the same way, o Sir, <supplied reason="subaudible">they</supplied> are affected by misfortune from that, the holy pacified bodily acts indeed … the life/humans, that is why <supplied reason="subaudible">there is</supplied> limitless pain, and misfortune in the world”.

The pacified act means the proper deeds, good deeds, correct deeds, not chastising <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> not causing harm to people. That is what is called the pacified act.

That is called the evil mind. The evil act means improper acts, bad acts, and incorrect acts, causing disturbance for the world, let alone causing the sorrow and death of his fellow human beings. Here are their kinds: stealing, plundering, poisoning, using black magic, striking, using mantras for invincibility*, striking innocent peoples, because of his wish to obtain wealth and pleasure. Those are regarded as evil acts. The evil speech means the words that are not pleasant to be heard, causing confusion to his fellow human beings, such as abusing, being envious*, speaking evil, envy for his fellow human beings, calling black magicians those who do not use black magic, accusing of stealing those who do not steal, calling enemies those who are not enemies, calling evil the holy man, <supplied reason="subaudible">as well as using</supplied> uncontrolled speech <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> harsh speech.
