         <div n="1" corresp="#siksaguru_01">
    <p n="1" corresp="#siksaguru_01.01">I will first teach the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign> as follows. You will succeed in listening to the discussion of the holy <foreign>dharma</foreign> and the determined state of the holy gnosis. There is what is called the pure circle of three bodily domains,<note>On the concept of <foreign>trikāya-maṇḍala-pariśuddha</foreign>, see Chapter 9.XX (§Dharma and Three Bodily Domains).</note> uttered by the teacher to the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>. That is possibly the action, speech, and mind. If there is a feeling of loss in your heart,<note>The emendation of <foreign>pr̥dayanta</foreign> into <foreign>hr̥dayanta</foreign> is not only easily justifiable on palaeographic grounds, but also based on the connection of <foreign>līna</foreign> ‘feeling of lost’ with hati ‘heart’ in several OJ texts. Cf. RY 24.41: <foreign>aḍā kalana līna riṅ hati</foreign>.</note> it is them that should be practiced and restrained. You should just guard them and fix them, for they are  the causes of finding joy and sorrow, good and bad.</p>
             <p n="2" corresp="#siksaguru_01.02">If your action, your speech and your mind are unrighteous, in that case you surely obtain the wrong. If your action, your speech, your heart are righteous, in that case it is clear that you obtain the virtue. That is why there is a proverb “Thus one repeatedly baths, the water is touched by the original nature of the human: bad meets its bad, good meets its good”.<note>The water metaphor also occurs in SKK 20.2.</note> Likewise is human nature.</p>
             <p n="3" corresp="#siksaguru_01.03">What are the illustrations with regard to the consequence of this, [namely]: bad from its bad, good from its good? As follows is your analogy:<note>I consider the word <foreign>upadyanta</foreign> to be derived from Skt. <foreign>upādhi</foreign> ‘what is put in the place of another thing, substitute; anything that has the mere appearance, disguise, peculiarity, attribute; limitation, qualification, condition, postulate’ (OJED, s.v. <foreign>upadi</foreign>). In this text, it seems that this word is an equivalent of <foreign>lvir</foreign>, so I interpret it as ‘analogy, allusion’.</note> there is what is called the priceless jewel, its value can not be known, being incomparable<note><foreign>tan paprameya</foreign> is denazalitation of <foreign>maprameya</foreign>, which is not recorded in OJED, but it seems to have the same meaning as <foreign>aprameya</foreign> ‘immeasurable, countless, unfathomable, incomparable, indescribable, without equal’ (OJED, s.v.).</note> in terms of beauty. The meaning is: the priceless jewel and the most coveted jewel. Is it fitting to be bound to bell-metal, copper, and tin by you? What is the appropriateness [of such a condition]? It is evident that if its splendor and its shine come out, then your binding for the priceless jewel and your tieing for the most coveted gem in such a manner are appropriate.</p>
             <p n="4" corresp="#siksaguru_01.04">As follow is the word of the holy treatise: <quote><foreign>ləpas ca vuṅkunuṅ ceva, adhika udika tatte tatur tathya tuṅgəṅ, tad eva nigaḍyate</foreign>.</quote><note>This "hybrid Sanskrit" passage could not be traced. It is clear that this passage is not entirely in Sanskrit but a mixture of Sanskrit and Old Javanese. The word <foreign>ləpas</foreign> means 'release'; <foreign>vuṅkunuṅ</foreign> only appears in <foreign>pavuṅkunuṅ</foreign>, recorded among the list of <foreign>vatək i jro</foreign>. The reading of C is <foreign>buṅ kuniṅ</foreign> 'yellow bamboo' which is more understandable in meaning, although it is difficult to reconcile with the present context. The word <foreign>adhika</foreign> means ‘superior, eminent, excellent’, but <foreign>udika</foreign> is obscure; <foreign>tatte</foreign> (<foreign>tattve</foreign>?) and <foreign>tathya</foreign> probably convey the meaning of ‘true, truth’, and are probably attributes of <foreign>tatur</foreign> ‘gold’. The word <foreign>tuṅgəṅ</foreign> means ‘steadfast, firm, unmoved, unshaken’. The general meaning of this excerpt that I can guess based on the OJ exegesis is the statement that hair is unsuitable as the binding of a jewel.</note> Because what is considered loose hair is square hair (? <foreign>vulu pasagi</foreign>); there is the <foreign>uḍika</foreign>, the <foreign>tater</foreign>, and the lice.<note> The word <foreign>sorasa</foreign> is not recorded in OJED, but probably it refers to Skt. <foreign>saurasa</foreign> ‘a partic. insect infesting the hair’ (MW, s.v.).</note> Are all of them appropriate to be bound to the priceless jewel and chained to the most coveted jewel? No, it is not like that; they should be bound to the bell-metal, copper, and tin. Why is that appropriate? The binding to the priceless jewel, the chaining to the most coveted jewel, such is the word of the holy treatise: <quote><foreign>ləpas ca vuṅkunuṅ ceva, adhika udika tatte tatur tathya tuṅgəṅ nu yvagyanika</foreign></quote>.
.</p>
             <p n="5" corresp="#siksaguru_01.05">There is what is called the glowing gold,<note>The word <foreign>santaṅva</foreign> is not recorded in OJED, but the Old Sundanese SMG also has <foreign>santaṅva</foreign>. My interpretation is based on the interchangeability of <foreign>v</foreign> and <foreign>p</foreign> of the Skt. word <foreign>santāpa</foreign> ‘burning heat, glow, fire’ (OJED, s.v.).</note> beautiful gold; its value is one <foreign>kati</foreign>. The course of action<note><foreign>Vrəttya</foreign> is my conjectural emendation of <foreign>vrәt</foreign> (AB) and <foreign>vr(uḥ)nya</foreign> (C). I take it as an irrealis of <foreign>vr̥tti</foreign> ‘mode of being, nature, kind, activity, function; complex formation, compound, style of composition, mode of life, conduct; mode of being, nature.’ (OJED, s.v. <foreign>wr̥tti</foreign>).</note> will be [as follows]: it is mixed seven times seven [times],<note>The word <foreign>inapisan</foreign> is not recorded in the OJED. It is probably an -<foreign>in</foreign>- form of the second base of <foreign>apisan</foreign> 'to be one, to be united, joined' (OJED, s.v. <foreign>pisan</foreign>). However, I did not find the passive inapisan in the OJ corpus accessible to me. I do  not exclude the possibility to emend it to <foreign>linapisan</foreign> ‘to be layered’. The following combination, <foreign>pituṅ apitu</foreign>, is also not found in the corpus. My translation ‘seven times seven [times]’ is tentative.</note> transforming into the weight of one <foreign>tahil</foreign> of stone. How can it be strong, not undulating, unwavering, when it is set ablaze again? For only in this way is the best quality of all the gold, and then your binding of priceless jewels and your tying of the most coveted jewel are appropriate and good.</p>
             <p n="6" corresp="#siksaguru_01.06">It [i.e. gold] is bound with bell-metal, copper, and tin, its splendor and its shine are not coming out. What are the reasons why they are not appropriate? Wrong innate [disposition], wrong karma, wrong nature. Just so is the holy supreme <foreign>dharma</foreign>:<note>The meaning of <foreign>san hyaṅ dharma viśeṣa</foreign> is unclear; it probably refers to the personified holy soul since it is mentioned with <foreign>avakta</foreign> ‘your body’.</note> it is a priceless gem. And also your body: it  is the most coveted gem. </p>
             <p n="7" corresp="#siksaguru_01.07">Here is the analogy of bell-metal, copper, and tin: they are not appropriate to be bound to the priceless jewel, [and be]  tied by you to the most coveted jewel.</p> 
             <p n="8" corresp="#siksaguru_01.08">They are as follows: bad actions, improper speech, and impure minds towards all humans — especially toward scholars. The meaning is: bad actions, improper speech, and a dirty mind are really not appropriate; the holy <foreign>dharma</foreign> shall be reflected upon; furthermore, protect [it] in your body,<note> One would expect the irrealis or imperative form in this context, so the reading could be emended to <foreign>rakṣa</foreign>.</note> and even more so with respect to holy men.<note>Besides the term <foreign>paṇḍita</foreign>, which I consistently translated as 'scholar,' we find several synonyms to denote the teacher, one of which is vvaṅ <foreign>sādhu</foreign> ‘holy man; saint’, as we see in this paragraph. Another word that is also used as a synonym for <foreign>paṇḍita</foreign> is <foreign>vvaṅ atuha</foreign> (equivalent to Sanskrit <foreign>guru</foreign>?).</note> No, it is not proper [to have improper speech, etc.]: repeatedly your birth [arises]; one stops to desire having a child, having a wife, building a family, having relatives and a mother in law. He is unable to protect [himself] from bad actions, improper speech, a bad mind towards all humans, and especially towards ascetics. How would your protection of your body be appropriate? That is ‘the glowing’ (santaṅva) according to the scholar. It means the glowing gold: the good action, the good speech, the good heart. Those should be protected by [means of] the holy <foreign>dharma</foreign>.</p>
             <p n="9" corresp="#siksaguru_01.09">As follows is the reason why it is called the pure circle of three bodily domains, according to the scholar: tri means three. The circle of three bodily domains is pure.<note>From a stylistic point of view characteristic of <foreign>tutur</foreign> genre, the explanation of the gloss <foreign>trikāya maṇḍala pariśuddha</foreign> in this sentence is rather unusual. Normally, each Sanskrit term is described individually. Could it be that all manuscripts are corrupt in this passage? The description of the Old Sundanese version in SMG for the same terminology is more elaborated than that of the SiGu.</note> So it is said. Thus are the three bodily domains, according to the scholar.</p> 
             <p n="10" corresp="#siksaguru_01.10">As follows is the beginning<note>The word <foreign>təmbǝy</foreign> seems to be a typical OJ word in  the manuscript tradition in West Java, occurring instead of the more common <foreign>tambay</foreign> or <foreign>tambe</foreign>. OS texts also have <foreign>tǝmbəy</foreign>. MdS only has its derived form <foreign>mitəmbəyan</foreign> ‘to start’.</note> of the affection of a scholar toward the servant of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>. It is pure in good thought. Do it quickly! Do not be tucked in with dirty thoughts.  The heart and mind are pure. Then, purify the mind and the set of your emotions! You should be aware when thinking; you should practice the activity of begging for alms (<foreign>bhikṣā-lakṣanam</foreign>)<note>The compound <foreign>bhikṣā-lakṣanam</foreign> is unattested in OJ and my translation, based on the understanding of <foreign>lakṣaṇa</foreign> in its Old Javanese sense of ‘action, doing, practice’ etc. (see OJED s.v.) is tentative. Alternatively, it may be rendered as  ‘the one of mendicant (<foreign>bhiksu</foreign>) character’.</note> with full attention.</p>
             <p n="11" corresp="#siksaguru_01.11">Here are your characteristics, O holy man. Do not just be attached to servants. It is evident when the hair has been cut. Cut it [so that] there is no obstruction or hindrance. That is the purity (<foreign>pariśuddha</foreign>): you should cut it before and you should control it. It is what is called †<foreign>r̥kr̥t</foreign>† gold, and making flower offerings with water.<note>All manuscripts have vañva, unattested in OJED. I take it to be a variant of <foreign>bañu</foreign>. However, the irrealis form seems unnecessary. Or should it be read <foreign>vaño</foreign>?</note> In this manner you serve the scholar. Do not commit the sin of violating the guru’s bed (<foreign>gurutalpaka</foreign>),<note> The term <foreign>gurutalpaka</foreign>, 'the teacher's bed', denotes a negative behaviour: AgP 353.19 explains it as marrying (or having sex with) the teacher's wife or the  teacher's child: <foreign>gurutalpaka ṅaranya makastrī rabiniṅ guru</foreign>, <foreign>anakniṅ guru</foreign>. In SiGu, this term is not to be confused with the more common <foreign>guru talapakan</foreign>, meaning the 'teacher's foot soless', or total devotion toward the teacher. See <ptr target="#xml:id=siksaguru_05"/>.</note> [which is] a misfortune for the world; [rather, you] should fear him. You should be devoted and submit to the teacher, you should carry out [acts of] extreme respect toward the teacher, including scholars. [In this manner you] come to the realization of that goal.</p>
             <p n="12" corresp="#siksaguru_01.12">In this manner you are the servant of the scholar, and even more so of the king. Do not be unfaithful toward the king. [You] will be fined and hated. You should be afraid of him, so that you will not be sold and die horribly. You should be loyal to the king: that is why [you] come to the realization of that goal (i.e., avoiding being sold and dying). You<note>This implies the audience of the text involved rāma etc. Alternatively, if the word kasādhyanya indicates the fruit to be enjoyed rather than the realization of the goal of loyalty to the king, one could translate as follows: ‘You [will become] in this manner: an elder (<foreign>rāma</foreign>), a <foreign>kalaṅ</foreign>, a <foreign>gusti</foreign>, a vizir (<foreign>patih</foreign>) in the village (<foreign>banva</foreign>)’.</note> elder (<foreign>rāma</foreign>), <foreign>kalaṅ</foreign>, <foreign>gusti</foreign>, vizir (<foreign>patih</foreign>) in the village (<foreign>banva</foreign>),  [should behave] in this manner. Furthermore, [concerning] the quality (<foreign>dharma</foreign>) of a balanced mind in people like you, you should not have an unbalanced voice<note><foreign>timpaṅ</foreign> means ‘crippled, limp’ (OJED, s.v.). In this context of legal preceding, I interpret it as ‘unbalanced’.</note> in the legal proceeding, do not lean left and right with respect to good and bad qualities. It is not appropriate [as the] behavior of an experienced man, says the holy scriptures. That [wrong behavior] should not be followed by you, that is the reason why [if you follow it] the three domains of body and mind (<foreign>trikāya maṇḍalam cittam</foreign>) are not achieved. Then the servants of the <foreign>dharma</foreign> should devote their full attention to what is called ‘the sacred circle of the three pure bodily domains’. It is the beginning of the affection of the scholar toward the servants of the <foreign>dharma</foreign>.</p>

              <p n="2" corresp="#siksaguru_02.02"><foreign>Śrotra</foreign> means ears. What is the sphere of the ears? They serve as a gate to hear the bad and good words.

How could they (i.e., the eyes) cause joy? They serve as your instrument to see the good deeds. You are without hindrance<note>My interpretation of <foreign>laṅsar</foreign> as ‘unobstructed, without hindrance’ is based on the meaning in MdS (Hardjadibrata, 2003: s.v. langsar), which seems to be adequate with the context.

However, the sentence <foreign>mulata mas ri paḍanya janma len saka rika</foreign> is problematic for several reasons. First, the phrase <foreign>mulata mas</foreign> is difficult to understand in this context. Second, while the sequence <foreign>len saka rika</foreign> occurs very often, meaning ‘other than that’, in this context, I am inclined to consider <foreign>len</foreign> as an attribute to <foreign>janma</foreign>, so <foreign>janma len</foreign> would mean ‘other people.’ Indeed, this phrase is rarely found in OJ, but it is attested in BY 15.16: <foreign>yan movaha kita janma len kakanta</foreign>.

However, I cannot interpret what kind of disease that is referred to by the term <foreign>jaroṅən</foreign>.</note> <foreign>sumbilaṅ</foreign>-like disease,<note> In MdS, the word sumbilang refers to the eeltail catfish whose tails are elongated in an eel-like fashion. Cf. Mal. <foreign>ikan sembilang</foreign>. Danadibrata (2006, s.v. <foreign>sumbilangeun</foreign>) denotes <foreign>sumbilangeun</foreign> as “<foreign>nyeri cecelekitan di jero parindikan</foreign>” (a sudden pain sensation [like those of a prick with a needle] in the abdomen).</note> mad (? epilepsy), abdominal distension, fever, liver disease. Those are what is called the sorrow from the gods. The sorrow from oneself are: monocular blindness, cleft lip, crippled, blind and deaf, rash (<foreign>beaṅ</foreign>),<note> The word <foreign>beaṅ</foreign> is not found in MdS. Cf. OJ <foreign>vyaṅ</foreign> ‘reddish’, also Malay <foreign>biang keringat</foreign> ‘ruam (bintik-bintik merah pada kulit)’.</note> cut (off ears?, <foreign>rumpuṅ</foreign>), cut off. Those are called the sorrow of the body. As for what is called the sorrow of the three worlds : servants, dry rice-field peasants, tappers, wet rice-field peasants, vataṅan workers (pavataṅan ?),<note>I wonder whether the word pavataṅan is derived from <foreign>vataṅan</foreign> ‘a certain part of the kraton (palace)’, i.e, the person who works in the place?</note> are used as feet, are used as hands, do not have anything special in their life, in their creations, in their qualities. That is called the sorrow of the three worlds. As for what is called the sorrow of the natural world wide are: settlements are on fire, crop failure, settlements are worsted, they are defeated by the epidemic, flying white ants appear in the wrong season, every kind of animal scattered dies (<foreign>ñarak</foreign>),<note>In OS, this word <foreign>ñarak</foreign> is only attested in SMG in the same context as we have here. The word <foreign>ñarak</foreign> is also not recorded MdS. However, <foreign>añarak</foreign> means ‘to drink’ in OJ, which does not fit the context. My interpretation is based on the relation of the base word <foreign>sarak</foreign> with Mal. <foreign>serak</foreign> 'scattered in disorder’.</note> all the fruit trees not to bear fruits. Those are called the sorrow of the world.</p>
