<p>
Let there be no hindrances!
</p>
                 
<p>The author of the compendium<note>OJED glosses <foreign>saṅgraha</foreign> as ‘seizing, grasping? drawing together?; ready, holding os. ready, prepared; equipped with, ready to make use of; occupying os. with, concerning os. with’, but in this context the most appropriate meaning appears to be the one attested in Sanskrit, namely ‘a compendium, summary, catalogue, list, epitome, abridgement, short statement’ (MW), often appearing in the title of Sanskrit scriptures (e.g. such early Śaiva works as the RauSS and SBSS).</note> spoke. His words were:<note>If this incipit referred to the whole stanza, it would be incoherent, since the direct speech of the sage starts in the second line, as is also apparent from the exegesis.</note></p>
                 <p rend="stanza" n="1">Having<seg cert="low">Sage</seg> bowed down with the head to God, the sage without sensual desire<note>For a discussion of the expression <foreign>munir amanmathaḥ</foreign>, cf. Introduction, p. <ref>mangalaauthorship</ref>.</note> speaks:<note>I have emended <foreign>vākya</foreign> (<seg xml:lang="kawi">ᬯᬵᬓ᭄ᬬ}</seg>t) o <foreign>vakti</foreign> (<seg xml:lang="kawi">ᬯᬵᬓ᭄ᬢᬶ</seg>). Compare the colophon of the NīSāSam: <foreign>praṇāmya śirasā devam| ... vakti</foreign>.</note> ‘O God of Gods, Mahādeva, Parameśvara, Śaṅkara!’
</p>

<p>The reverend sage Bhārgava desired to ask the Lord about the state of extinction. Such was his intention. He worshiped the Lord <foreign>with the head</foreign>, by means of his head.<note>OJED glosses <foreign>makakaraṇa</foreign> as ‘to have as reason; because of’, but here the word represents the Old Javanese rendering of the instrumental <foreign>śirasā</foreign>, literally ‘using the head as the instrument’.</note> Having finished to worship, he spoke: ‘<foreign>O God of Gods</foreign>, o God of all the Gods! <foreign>O Mahādeva</foreign>, o you who are called Lord Mahādeva! <foreign>O Maheśvara</foreign>,<note>The verse actually reads Parameśvara.</note>o you who are called Lord Maheśvara! <foreign>O Śaṅkara</foreign>, o you who are called Lord Śaṅkara!’</p><p rend="stanza" n="2">‘The excellent extinction, void, how is it perceived as the state of Śiva’s limbs?’ Having heard this unequalled speech, God became present.<note>I translate ’<foreign>vatiṣṭhata</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">ex em</hi>., for ’<foreign>vātiṣṭḥata</foreign>, m.c.) in the sense of ‘to reach down, go down into’ rather than ‘to exist, be present’, assuming that the idea is that Śiva ‘becomes present’ or ‘manifests’ Himself to the sage, and reveals to him the scripture.</note>
</p>


<p>‘Thus I would like to ask to the Lord. There is the state of void. That is designated as liberation. It is supreme. It is called Śiva.  <foreign>Is perceived</foreign>, When He is seen by the Leader among Yogins, <foreign>in what place</foreign>, By Your leave, where is the place of His manifestation?’ The excellence of the sage’s speech being such, it was heard by the Lord.
<hi rend="italic">God spoke</hi>—the Lord spoke, His words were:</p><p rend="stanza" n="3">[Here is]<seg cert="low">Lord</seg> my speech to you: within his own body, inside the heart, the great yogin sees Parameśvara, whose splendour equals that of ten thousand suns.
</p>

<p>My speech to you is as follows: the great yogin sees the Lord Parameśvara—He is splendid like the splendour of ten thousand suns—there in his body, and in his heart.</p><p rend="stanza" n="4">[The yogin] sees [a form] like a whirlpool in the water, which abides in the heart of all beings. Without beginning, middle part and end, immortal, it is the mental representation of Śiva’s  [mantric] limbs.
</p>

<p>The manifestation of the Lord Śiva abides in the heart of all the embodied creatures. Without beginning, without middle part, without end, Its existence is permanent. Its form is like a whirlpool in the water. It is seen by the Leader among Yogins.</p><p rend="stanza" n="5">It<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.5</ref></seg> is seen through the Sense-Mind, with the equalized sight,<note>Or: ‘the sight that has become the same as [that reality]’.</note> o hero! It is perceived in the cavity of the heart, in the forehead, and within the skull.
 </p>
 
 <p>Such state is seen by you through your Sense-Mind, and through the intellect that has subdued the organs of perception, there in the mass of the heart, in the forehead, and in the middle of the skull. Thus is my speech to you, o hero.</p><p rend="stanza" n="6">Wherever<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.6-7</ref></seg> it is seen,<note>In order to match the gloss <foreign>katon</foreign>, the stem should be <foreign>udīkṣya</foreign>, which is however unmetrical; therefore, I take <foreign>uddīkṣya</foreign> to be an Aiśa stem, m.c. One could imagine that the commentator confused it with <foreign>uddiśya</foreign>, but the parallel in JñS 25.4c speaks against this possibility.</note> it is obtained there. [There is] the shape of a lotus-bud, bringing  forth  a triangle.<note>MW glosses <foreign>samīraṇa</foreign> as ‘setting in motion, causing activity, stimulating, promoting’, etc. In 3.13 and 4.53, <foreign>samīratva</foreign> and <foreign>samīraṇa</foreign> are glossed as <foreign>vāyu</foreign> ‘wind’; cf. <foreign>Abhi\-dhar\-ma\-ko\-śa</foreign> 1.12 (p. 8): <foreign>īraṇā vāyudhātuḥ| īryate ’nayā bhūtasroto</foreign>..., ‘The element Wind is impulse;  through that, the flow of elements is set in motion’.</note>
</p>

 
<p>If such state is seen by the Leader among Yogins, it is obtained by him there. Further, there is a triangle placed on the top of a lotus. It has an opening.</p><p rend="stanza" n="7">In<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.6-7</ref></seg> the heart, between the two breasts of all the embodied beings,<note>I emend <foreign>kāladehināṁ</foreign> to <foreign>kaladehinām</foreign>, where <foreign>kala</foreign>- may be an elision for <foreign>sakala</foreign>: cf. the gloss °<foreign>niṅ sarva māvak</foreign>. Alternatively, one could understand <foreign>kala</foreign> (= <foreign>kalā</foreign>) as ‘discrete’ or ‘gross’.</note> turned upside down, is the root of the ten tubes, which hang down from it.
 </p>
 
 <p>The heart of every embodied being looks like turned upside down. It resides in the space between the two breasts. Clearly, it is the root of the ten tubes. They are special. They look like hanging down.</p><p rend="stanza" n="8">The<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.8</ref></seg> Great Tube is between the breasts, thin, black, [carrying] an excellent nectar.  It circulates inside the whole heart, having the same glare of pounded black antimony.<note>I take <foreign>bhinnā| nīlāñjanasamaprabhā</foreign> to be a split compound—compare the parallels in Sanskrit (Tantric) texts, e.g. RāNi 13.98b (<foreign>bhin\-na\-nī\-lāñ\-ja\-na\-pra\-bham</foreign>), ĪŚGDP 39.106c (<foreign>bhin\-na\-nī\-lāñ\-ja\-na</foreign>°), SvT 10.446a, 14.23c  (<foreign>bhin\-nā\-ñja\-na\-ni\-bhā</foreign>/°<foreign>aḥ</foreign>), VT 32a, 106c (<foreign>bhin\-nāñ\-ja\-na</foreign>°), etc.</note> 
</p>

<p>The Great Tube tube resides in the heart. It is black and thin. It is the great nectar. Its glare is like that of black antimony. It raises up as far as the head when [coming] from the heart.<note>The commentator probably understood °<foreign>anta</foreign>° in the sense of ‘extremity’ (i.e., head) instead of ‘inside’.</note></p><p rend="stanza" n="9">There<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.9</ref></seg> resides Śiva, the Chief of the Gods, void, without sense-organs,<note>Thus MW<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="italic">Lex</hi></hi> s.v. <foreign>nirindriya</foreign>, implying that Śiva has no body. cf. <foreign>vigatendriyaḥ</foreign> in 2.14.</note> without modifications, the Great Soul, the very life of the beings.
</p>

<p>There in the tube resides the Lord Śiva. He is obeyed by all the Gods. He is void. <foreign>Without sense-organs</foreign>, He is free from the Sixteen Evolutes.<note>Here <foreign>nirindriya</foreign> seems to be a <foreign>pratīka</foreign> quoting from <foreign>pada</foreign> b, but the gloss <foreign>kinatayan ta sira deniṅ ṣoḍaśavikāra</foreign> is likely to respond to <foreign>nirvikāro</foreign> in <foreign>pada</foreign> c (which, however, I understand in its general sense of ‘without modifications’, i.e. ‘unchangeable’). One may assume that the gloss of <foreign>nirindriya</foreign> was omitted because of corruption, but the Sixteen Evolutes include \manas\ and the Ten Organs; thus, the exegesis may reflect a conflation of both words into a single gloss</note> He is the highest. He is not affected by modifications. He is the life of everything that exists.</p><p rend="stanza" n="10">Immovable, He  sets in motion the entire universe made of inanimate and animate beings. Omnipervasive, eternally existent, [He] is difficult to be known by those devoid of knowledge, o Hero.
</p>

<p>The manifestation of the Lord Śiva that abides in it is omnipervasive and eternal. He observes, immovable. He is difficult to be known by those who are deficient in knowledge. He does not move in the entire universe,<note>The Old Javanese gloss passes over in silence the causative <foreign>cālayet</foreign> in the verse, characterizing the Lord as unmoving mover of the universe</note> formed by the immovable and movable beings.</p><p rend="stanza" n="11">Mahādeva perpetually abides in the heart of the incarnated beings. He is perceived by the knower of the Gnosis as a great vacuity, like the atmosphere.
</p>
 
<p>The Lord Mahādeva perpetually abides in the mass of the heart, within every embodied being.  He cannot be confined: His form is like Space. He is seen by he who knows about the Gnosis.</p><p rend="stanza" n="12">The ten tubes would be sunbeams, issuing from the heart and spreading out within the entire body, like the rays of the sun across the universe.
</p>


<p>The ten tubes travel along from the heart of the embodied beings, filling the entire universe.<note>The commentary interprets <foreign>sarve</foreign> as agreeing with <foreign>jagati</foreign> rather than <foreign>śarīre</foreign>.</note> Their appearance is like the splendour of the sun.</p><p rend="stanza" n="13">The<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.13-14</ref></seg> tube called Mālatī [resides] eight-hundred-fold inside [every] hair. Coming forth tortuously down to the navel, it brings satisfaction to Maheśvara.<note>I take <foreign>maheśvaraḥ</foreign> to be a nom. for acc. (<foreign>maheśvaraṁ</foreign>), as required by the logic of the passage and the Old Javanese gloss.</note>
</p>



<p>There is the tube called Mālatī: its magnitude is eight hundred times that of a hair.<note>The commentator seems to have misunderstood the expression <foreign>aṣṭaśatañ śiroruhe</foreign>, conveying just the opposite idea.</note> It reaches the mass of the heart, having the navel as its limit. This tube, being in such a manner, gives pleasure to the Lord  Parameśvara.<note>I have emended <foreign>tamar</foreign> (‘not’) <foreign>suka</foreign> (→ <foreign>sukha</foreign>?, ‘happiness’) to <foreign>ta mahasukha</foreign> (cf. OJED s.v. <foreign>amahasukha</foreign>, <foreign>mahasukha</foreign>, ‘to make happy, give pleasure to’), which apparently glosses <foreign>tuṣṭiṁ dattvā maheśvaraṁ</foreign> in the verse (where <foreign>maheśvaraṁ</foreign> is my emendation of <foreign>maheśvaraḥ</foreign>).</note></p><p rend="stanza" n="14">The tube called Nālaretakā has the radiance of a dark cloud.<note>For this translation of <foreign>hima</foreign>, cf. Introduction, p. <ref>hima</ref>.</note> [It] would be two times the unit of measure [spanning a finger] in the heart, divided into parts up to the head.</p>

<p>Further, there is another tube, it is called Nālaretakā. Its splendour is black like the splendour of a [dark] cloud. Its length would be two spans of the little finger. [Coming] from the heart, [it raises] up to the skull.</p><p rend="stanza" n="15">First I shall explain to you everything about the root of these tubes without remainder, o Indra among the kings of the twice-borns.<note>This stanza seems to be misplaced, for the topic changes in the following stanza. The exegesis, apparently grasping this inconsistency, introduces a new topic, passing over in silence the tubes.</note></p>

<p>First I shall teach you as follows, o king of the twice-borns. I [will] teach that to you without remainder.</p><p rend="stanza" n="16">Now I will explain the divine ordinance inside the heart. O Indra among the kings of twice-borns, listen carefully: there is a sanctuary in the heart.</p>

<p>There is a technique<note>The meaning of <foreign>yukti</foreign> here seems to be akin to that of its Sanskrit counterpart, i.e. ‘application, practice, usage, means’ (note that the word derives from <foreign>yuj</foreign>, from which <foreign>yoga</foreign> also derives). None of these meanings are found in OJED. Could it have been intended as a gloss of <foreign>vidhānaka</foreign>, understood in the sense of <foreign>vidhāna</foreign>, ‘disposing, arranging’, ‘acting, performing’, ‘method, manner’ (MW)?</note> that should be carried out by the master. I will teach that to you now. The Lord is treasured in your heart. You should be fully intent [on Him], o Indra among the kings of twice-borns.</p><p rend="stanza" n="17">In<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.17</ref></seg> the cavity inside the heart, o hero, there are five colours, of extraordinary radiance: red, tri-coloured, black, bright yellow,<note>MW s.v. <foreign>dīpta</foreign> gives, among other meanings, ‘blazing, flaming, hot, shining, bright, brilliant, splendid’, as well as ‘red arsenic’ (L.) and ‘gold’ (L.). In this context, the meaning of ‘golden’, i.e., ‘bright yellow’, seems the most appropriate.</note> and resembling a  crystal.</p>
 
<p>There are colours, five in number. Their luminosity is exceptional. They reside in the mass of the heart, which has a cavity. Their appearance is [as follows]: the red is Aghora. The tri-coloured—red, white,  and black—is Tatpuruṣa. The black looks like black antimony. It is Sadya (i.e., Sadyojāta). The one like the splendour of the sun, He is Vāmadeva. The one like a rock crystal, He is Īśāna. Thus is their series. You should know that, o hero.</p><p rend="stanza" n="18">Pure, subtle, supreme, void, imperishable: Śiva is the state of isolation, free from disease, without cessation, without beginning, middle, or end.</p>

<p>There is the state of Void. It is pure. It is supreme. It is subtle—<foreign>paramasūkṣma</foreign>. It is called the <foreign>state of isolation</foreign>, without cessation, without beginning, without middle, without end. It is the cause of everything that exists, and its place of dissolution.</p><p rend="stanza" n="19">Spotless, without form, without limbs, spread out,<note>I take <foreign>vinis{\rdit}ta</foreign> to be the same as <foreign>viniḥs{\rdit}ta</foreign>, as recorded in MW (‘gone forth or out, issued forth, sprung from’, ‘escaped’). The exegesis understands it as an adjective, glossing <foreign>vyāpaka</foreign>, hence my translation (‘spread out’). It is, however, not impossible that the original reading was <foreign>vinism{\rdit}tam</foreign>, ‘recorded, mentioned’, the gloss reflecting a corrupted version of the <foreign>pada</foreign>.</note> the immaculate state<note>Or: ‘the remains, i.e. a feeble reflex of’ (MW).</note> of the Eightfold Śiva, the supreme extinction, imperishable.</p>



<p>Not affected by maculation, without form, without limbs, pervasive: that is the place of the reverend Eightfold Śiva, without defects.<note>cf. OJED s.v. <foreign>macala</foreign> (<foreign>cala</foreign> III). Alternatively: ‘unmoving/unquivering’ (<foreign>cala I</foreign>).</note> It is supreme.</p><p rend="stanza" n="20">This [state] is the supreme extinction; this is the pacifying [state] of isolation. It is called Paramātman, Mahādeva, Parameśvara.</p>

<p>Such a state, it is the supreme extinction. It is the state of isolation. It is Pa\-ra\-māt\-man. It is Mahādeva. It is Parameśvara by name.</p><p rend="stanza" n="21">Having<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.21</ref></seg> visualized, with the greatest concentration, Śiva as the Supreme Brahman that is said to be woven lengthwise and crosswise [in the fabric of the universe],<note>On <foreign>ūta</foreign>-<foreign>prota</foreign> in Sanskrit and Old Javanese texts, cf. Acri 2017: 399–402, 424.</note> the sage shall obtain that [state] in the heart and in the forehead.
</p>

<p>There is the state of Śiva, called the Supreme Brahman. That should be visualized by the adept by means of his mind. When it is obtained, it is there in the mass of the heart. He should exercise concentration.</p><p rend="stanza" n="22">In the head the sage shall reach the Paramount Śiva. Having died, o hero, [he] sets out; through concentration, he firmly establishes himself [there].</p>
 
<p>There, in his head,<note>I have emended  <foreign>uṅguh</foreign> to  <foreign>uṅgul</foreign>: cf. OJED s.v. <foreign>uṅgul</foreign>*, <foreign>aṅuṅgul</foreign>, <foreign>paṅuṅgul</foreign> ‘(avs) to tower, soar, rise on high’, and Indonesian <foreign>unggul</foreign>, ‘superior, distinguished, supreme’. This word is likely to be the Old Javanese counterpart of the Sanskrit <foreign>mūrdhan</foreign>: ‘head in general, skull, (fig.) the highest or first part of anything, top, point, summit, front’ (MW).</note> it should be made object of his meditation. When the adept dies, he enters the station of the Lord Śiva. He becomes closely united with the Lord Śiva by means of his concentration. Thus is my speech to you, o Hero.</p><p rend="stanza" n="23">By<seg cert="low">▷ <ref type="page">1.23</ref></seg> means of his very mind [the yogin] should recognize Viśvadeva abiding in the heart, having the appearance of red-brown inflamed copper, having the same splendour of a ruby gem,   [having] the glare of many fires, [present] inside the innermost part of the mind, looking like a shining sun, reddish-brown as a burning fire.</p>


<p>There is a red abode. Its appearance is like inflamed copper. Its glare is like a ruby gem; like a sun that has just risen; and like the blaze of fire. Its deity is Viśvadeva. It resides in the heart. Aghora is the seed-syllable there: <hi rend="caps">oṁ aṁ namaḥ</hi>. That should be known by the adept [to exist] in the sky,<note>Glossing  the first <foreign>antare</foreign> in <foreign>antare manaso ’ntare</foreign> as <foreign>ākāśa</foreign>, the commentator seemingly understands it as ‘intermediate space’ (MW), a synonym of  <foreign>antarikṣa</foreign>.</note> in the innermost part  of the mind, by means of his mind.</p><p rend="stanza" n="24">Within it there would be the three-coloured one, having the appearance of a rainbow. Its seed-syllable is the pentad of the [Subtle] Elements. Thus is the supreme Tatpuruṣa.</p>


<p>There is the three-coloured one—red, white, black. There the seed-syllable is Tatpuruṣa. It abides in the heart. Its appearance is like a rainbow: black, red, white. The Five Subtle Elements and the Intellect, they serve  as the abode of Tatpuruṣa, the seed-syllable there: <hi rend="caps">oṁ taṁ namaḥ</hi>.</p><p rend="stanza" n="25">That which has been taught to be in such a manner is the vital breath of the embodied beings, in the form of the Brahmamantras. Taught to be of black colour, it has the same splendour of antimony.</p>

</p>

<p>The reality of the holy syllable <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi> is as follows: if the reverend Rudra is the syllable <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi>, the holy <hi rend="caps">u</hi> is Umā. If the reverend Brahmā is the syllable <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi>, the holy syllable <hi rend="caps">u</hi> is <hi rend="caps">svāhā</hi>.

OJED s.v.: ‘(Skt <foreign>dampati</foreign>, Wed., lord of the house; <foreign>dampatī</foreign>, “the two masters”, husband and wife) man and wife; a couple, pair; forming a pair, with his wife’. The commentator interpreted  <foreign>svāhāpati</foreign> (or the corrupt  <foreign>svāhāpatni</foreign>) in the verse as a <foreign>dvandva</foreign>  meaning ‘<hi rend="caps">svāhā</hi> and [her] husband’.</note> It should be known by the learned masters.</p><p rend="stanza" n="7">This <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi> should come first, then, having [proffered:] the mantra and carried out the cleansing, one should make the ash-fist, [uttering:] ‘May the human being become Śiva!’

</p>

<p>How is the ash processed by the learned master? As follows: the holy Brahmamantras stand for the wood. The holy syllable <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi> stands for the fire, which burns the wood. The Goddess Umā is the splendour of the fire.

</p>

<p>The learned master knows about the performance of the holy ashes: that is why he worships the reverend  Agni (i.e., the sacred fire). The seed-syllables stand for the holy Brahmamantras. Those are his means of worshiping the reverend Agni. The holy syllable <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi> together with the holy <hi rend="caps">svāhā</hi>, those stand for the fire.

</p>

<p>Here is what should be known by he who desires [to obtain] the abode of the Lord: the reverend Brahmā is in the palm. He is visible there.<note>The commentator understands <foreign>karatalaṁ</foreign> as if it were a locative (<foreign>karatale</foreign>).</note> The reverend Viṣṇu is the fore part [of the hand]. The reverend Śiva is in all the  fingers.<note>I have emended <foreign>pūrvvāṅguli</foreign> to <foreign>sarvāṅguli</foreign>, so as to reflect the Sanskrit. In this context, <foreign>pūrva</foreign> is likely to refer to a part of the hand (the fore part?) rather than the first finger (<foreign>pūrvāṅguli</foreign>); further, it is appropriate for Śiva—conceived of as having a  fivefold manifestation as Sadāśiva—to be identified with the five fingers of the hand.</note> The knowledge  of the practitioner about the reality of the holy ashes of Śiva, along with their emplacement [on the hand], is easy indeed.</p><p rend="stanza" n="12">Śiva is declared to be the ash, and the palm the altar.

<p>The holy ashes of Śiva should be known by the practitioner:<note>It appears that here the commentator took the sequence <foreign>śiva-bhasma</foreign> in the verse, where <foreign>śiva</foreign> may reflect a <foreign>prātipadika</foreign> for <foreign>śivo bhasma</foreign>, as a compound (compare the expression <foreign>saṅ hyaṅ śivabhasma</foreign> in dyads 11 and 13 and throguhout this chapter), whereas two separate words were probably intended; my translation reflects this original meaning. Alternatively, one may read <foreign>saṅ hyaṅ śiva bhasma kavruhana saṅ sādhaka</foreign>, and translate it as ‘The reverend Śiva should be be known by the practitioner as the ashes’, which however does not mirror the structure of the remainder of the gloss, which is more idyomatic to express this type of comparisons.</note> the altar is in the palm; the fingers are the firewood; the lines of the palm are the lotus-<foreign>maṇḍala</foreign>.</p><p rend="stanza" n="13">He should divide the head into five parts, and proffer the fivefold mantra. <hi rend="caps">sa</hi> is in the East, <hi rend="caps">ba</hi> in the South.

<p>What is the reason why the learned master is united [with the Lord] by way of turning the holy ashes of Śiva as means of livelihood?

</p>

<p>Such is the reason why the holy ashes of Śiva are special. The reverend Tri\-sa\-ma\-ya<note>cf. OJED s.v.: ‘(‘‘the meeting of three’’?) name of the trinity Brahmā, Wiṣṇu, Śiwa’.</note> is in the ashes: the Lord Viṣṇu is the <hi rend="caps">sa</hi>, the Lord Śiva is the <hi rend="caps">ma</hi>, the Lord Brahmā is the <hi rend="caps">bha</hi>.

The<seg cert="low">Lord</seg> discussion of the holy ashes of Śiva, which has been spoken about to you, o Goddess, is finished. Now I shall teach you another [topic:] the fruit of the daily cleansing.<note>Although there is no difference in the manuscripts, I normalize <foreign>śoca</foreign> to <foreign>śauca</foreign> in the verses, and retain <foreign>śoca</foreign> (attested as such in OJED) in the exegesis.</note></p><p rend="stanza" n="1">O Goddess, the fruit of the cleansing with leaves, if [performed] everyday, is a thousand-fold; [that  of]  the cleansing with earth and water is a hundred thousand-fold and a million-fold [respectively].

<p>The leaves used as a means for the cleansing, their fruit is a thousand, if [used] everyday. The earth used as a means for the cleansing, its fruit is one hundred thousand. The water used as a means for the cleansing, its fruit is a million.

Alternatively, one could read (as it was perhaps originally intended) <foreign>pattra-śaucānāṁ</foreign> (in lieu of <foreign>pattraṁ śaucana\ṁm</foreign>, m.c.), meaning ‘Among the cleansings, the one with leaves’—cf. such similar expressions as <foreign>sarveṣām eva śaucānām| annaśaucaṁ paraṁ sm{\rdit}tam</foreign> in ViSm 22.89), etc.</note> is the lowest.

<p>The sequence is as follows: the leaves used as a means for the cleansing would be the lowest. The earth used as a means for the cleansing would  be middling.

<p>The leaves, earth, water, and ashes used as means of cleansing are lower than the cleansing through gnosis.

Does it have a mantra,<note>I have emended <foreign>āparan mantra kari ya</foreign> to <foreign>apa samantra kari ya</foreign>, for here the intention of the author was apparently to introduce the question as to whether the seed-syllable has a mantra or not (<foreign>tan pamantra kunәṅ</foreign>)—thus, the <foreign>apa</foreign> responds to the <foreign>kiṁ</foreign> in the Sanskrit;  <foreign>āparan</foreign>,  glossed in OJED as ‘what/which/what sort of?’, would be pleonastic here: cf. line 2.</note> or is it without mantra?

</p>

<p>The words of the Lord were as follows: The <hi rend="caps">bha</hi> is the form of the reverend Brahmā. The <hi rend="caps">sa</hi> is the form of the reverend Viṣṇu. The <hi rend="caps">ma</hi> is the form of Īśvara.

<p>As follows are the <foreign>material ashes</foreign>: the body is the material ashes. The gnosis is the <foreign>immaterial ashes</foreign>.<note>In the first line, the commentator construes <foreign>bhasma</foreign> with <foreign>sakalam</foreign> and <foreign>atiniṣkalam</foreign>, as if <foreign>pada</foreign> b read <foreign>jñāna-bhasmātiniṣkalam</foreign>.</note> Further, what is the gnosis higher than the gnosis?

Good and bad are carried out by him indeed, for the state of release is difficult to be obtained by way of them.<note>I take <foreign>denira</foreign> to refer to the  actions (either, implicitly, the good ones, or both good and bad?) rather than meaning ‘by him’, for the point of the verse is that the yogin may actually obtain release through gnosis and not actions. Of course, it is also possible that the commentator misunderstood the verse.</note></p><p rend="stanza" n="10">This gnosis, o Great Goddess, is superior to all the ontic levels. It is also secret and difficult to achieve, bestowing heaven as well as release.
</p>

<p>The gnosis, o Goddess, is the highest among all the ontic levels. Further, it is difficult to be obtained.

</p>


<p>Thus is the excellence of the holy gnosis, o Goddess. That is why you should not teach it to other people, or to a disciple who is not of service. How is the nature of a disciple who may be instructed in the gnosis? He is virtuous, his appearance and acts are good. In this case, the excellent gnosis should be given, together with the performance of prescribed ceremonies and offerings, etc.</p><p rend="stanza" n="12">The wise one should arrange open halls;<note>Here <foreign>vidhānet</foreign> could be an Aiśa optative constructed out of the noun <foreign>vidhāna</foreign>, which thereby functions as a verbal root.</note> having entered, he should instruct [the pupil about] the group of three: Spirit, the Lord, and [that which is] characterised by the Constituents (i.e. Nature) indeed.
</p>

<p>How is the body of the gnosis? It is to be revealed as follows: the ‘Group of Three’ (<foreign>trigaṇa</foreign>) along with Tatpuruṣa and Īśāna.  ‘The Group of Three’ means  Sadyo[jāta], Bāma[deva], Aghora. As for Tatpuruṣa, [He is the] dot, [while] Īśāna [is] the resonance.<note>The commentator interpreted the verse, i.e. an enumeration of the three ontic levels from Nature to the Lord as homologues of the three constituents of the <hi rend="italic" type="title">oṁ</hi>, in order to make it fit within the fivefold mantric framework of the <foreign>pañcabrahmamantra</foreign>s and the audible/visible and inaudible/invisible components of the <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi>, forming the body of the Lord. This was done by taking <foreign>puruṣa</foreign> for Tatpuruṣa and <foreign>trigaṇa</foreign> (which could have possibly be <foreign>triguṇa</foreign> in origin; but for <foreign>trigaṇa</foreign> = <foreign>triguṇa</foreign>, cf. 2.2 and 4.28) for Sadyojāta, Bāmadeva, and Aghora, while passing over in silence <foreign>guṇalakṣaṇam</foreign>.</note></p><p rend="stanza" n="13">The <foreign type="normal">praṇava</foreign> is said to be ‘lumped together’ (<foreign type="normal">piṇḍitam</foreign>),<note>The<ptr target="pinditatransl"/> term <foreign>piṇḍa</foreign>   ‘lumped together’ denotes the aggregation of something. It is glossed in the exegesis as <foreign>patәmunikā</foreign>, ‘their coming together’ (i.e. the five constituents imagined as mantric limbs or faces of the Lord).  The term <foreign>piṇḍa</foreign> found in Tantric texts usually refers to one-syllable mantras, to <foreign>bījamantra</foreign>s (<foreign>piṇḍamantra</foreign>), or also to the ‘body’—the last meaning being attested in the Nātha and Kubjikāmata traditions, and also in the Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātrika JĀS (cf. TĀK III s.v. <foreign>piṇḍa</foreign>, <foreign>piṇḍamantra</foreign>). While the general meaning of  ‘lumped together’ does make sense here,  the meanings attested in Sanskrit sources seem to be equally apposite: the former would imply that the <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi> has been reduced to a single entity/<foreign>bījamantra</foreign> out of its distinct constituents (yet it is still ‘adorned’ or provided with the dot and the resonance), while the latter that the <foreign>oṁ</foreign>} (= gnosis) is conceived as the (mantric) body of the Lord, whose constituents have just been enumerated in dyad 8.12; cf. <foreign>avaknikaṅ jñāna</foreign>, ‘the body of the gnosis’, and also the <foreign>praṇava</foreign> being ‘adorned with’ (<foreign>bhūṣitam</foreign>)—as if it were a body—the dot and the resonance.</note> adorned with the dot and the resonance. He who knows thus is not born again. Thus [he] instantly [obtains the state] that transcends the letters.<note>cf. OJED s.v. <foreign>nirakṣara</foreign>: ‘the state of having transcended the sacred syllables, end of a progressive simplification (<foreign>daśākṣara</foreign>, <foreign>pañcākṣara</foreign>, <foreign>tri tinuṅgalakĕn rwa bhineda</foreign>) in obtaining union with the deity (cf. <foreign>adwaya</foreign>, <foreign>śūnya</foreign>)’.</note>
</p>

<p>The coming together of them all is regarded as the syllable <hi rend="caps">oṁ</hi> (<foreign>praṇavākṣara</foreign>). It contains the dot and the resonance. That should be known by the great master. If he knows about that, he does not come back to be born again. He does not incarnate and is not perceived in a material form by any sort of created beings.

</p><p type="ledinnernote" n="32"><foreign>O Great Goddess, one should reflect on the reality [of the souls] in order to enter Śiva</foreign>. All of them, their reality is known by the yogin, here through the holy Śaivasiddhānta, o Goddess. The reason why he is not released [is the following:] <foreign>The man who practices <foreign type="normal">mudrā</foreign>s suffers through illusion because of his ignorance</foreign>.<note>Here I translate <foreign>kṣamate</foreign> as ‘suffers’, and take <foreign>māyena</foreign> as an Aiśa instrumental masculine of <foreign>māyā</foreign> (compare the use of <foreign>māyāvimohitaḥ</foreign> in 8.4, 8.24, and 8.26, to denote such an ignorant man who engages in external practices). However, I wonder whether the original form of this <foreign>pada</foreign> might have been <foreign>mayā na kṣamyate mūrkhāt</foreign>, ‘he is not forgiven by me because of his ignorance’. The exegesis does not seem to render either of those forms, except <foreign>mūrkhāt</foreign> (my emendation of <foreign>muktaṁ</foreign> in all manuscripts; compare the use of the root <foreign>puṅguṅ</foreign> (<foreign>mapuṅguṅ, puṅguṅnira</foreign>) to gloss <foreign>mūrkhaḥ</foreign> (8.24), <foreign>mohāt</foreign> (8.25, 9.49), <foreign>mohita</foreign> (9.1), and <foreign>mūrkhena</foreign> (9.49).</note> Moreover, the adept who constantly practices <foreign>mudrā</foreign>s, he is overpowered because of his ignorance. Therefore, the yogin should not perform [them].

</p><p type="ledinnernote" n="33"><foreign>Here, o Great Goddess, this unfathomable</foreign> [<foreign>gnosis</foreign>] <foreign>itself is the Supreme Śiva</foreign>. Now, the immaterial gnosis, it is the Lord Paramaśiva Himself. I will teach you that, o Goddess.

Without a body, without organs, [it is] the state of isolation itself, immaterial. <foreign>The knower of reality, having known He who is called Śiva as being void</foreign> [<foreign>and</foreign>] <foreign>immaterial</foreign>. The body of the Lord [in His] immaterial [aspect] should be known by the knower of reality. <foreign>He abandons the liṅga</foreign>, [<foreign>which is also</foreign>] <foreign>immaterial</foreign> [<foreign>indeed</foreign>]. Since He (i.e., the Lord) is immaterial Himself,<note>Or: ‘has an immaterial body’.</note> he abandons the <foreign>liṅga</foreign>. <foreign>And the immaterial in the form of a <foreign type="normal">liṅga</foreign></foreign>.

<foreign>Thus [ends] the treatise entitled ‘The Succinct Exposition of the Gnosis’,newline  Chapter 3.</foreign></p>

             <div>

<head>The Storehouse of Worlds, Chapter 9</head>
<p rend="stanza" n="1">All<seg cert="low">Goddess</seg> the [souls] whose forms is light, the pure immaterial gnosis, [and] the precepts have been enunciated: having known [them], one [will not obtain] transmigration.
</p>


<p>The speech of the Lord to me before was as follows: according to your words, the yogin, if he knows about the immaterial gnosis—for it is the final delimitation of all the lights—surely he will not become an incarnated being again.</p><p rend="stanza" n="2">The <foreign type="normal">maṇḍala</foreign>s have been uttered to me, provided with all the deities; [they]  have been enunciated before, among other [topics].<note>I emend <foreign>purānyeṣā</foreign> to <foreign>purānyeṣām</foreign>, interpreting it as <foreign>purā</foreign>+<foreign>anyeṣām</foreign>. Alternatively, one could  divide <foreign>purāni</foreign> + <foreign>eṣām</foreign>, whereby <foreign>purāni</foreign>  means ‘cities’ or ‘residences’; but while this usage is attested in Sanskrit Tantric scriptures as a synonym of either <foreign>bhuvana</foreign> (‘world’) or <foreign>maṇḍala</foreign> (cf. TĀK III, s.v.), it does not seem to be attested in other Old Javanese texts. If this was the intended meaning here, it may refer to the <foreign>loka</foreign>s/<foreign>maṇḍala</foreign>s (e.g., <foreign>śakramaṇḍalam</foreign>) described in Chapter 3. The exegesis seems to either pass  <foreign>purā</foreign>° over in silence, or understand it in the sense of ‘body’ (<foreign>avakniṅ maṇḍala</foreign>, where °<foreign>niṅ maṇḍala</foreign> glosses  <foreign>eṣā\ṁm</foreign>)—a meaning recorded in MW.</note> Transmigration will not be obtained [by him].
</p>

<p>Thus was the speech to me:<note>Having emended <foreign>mamoktāni</foreign> to <foreign>mam</foreign> (m.c. for <foreign>mām</foreign>) <foreign>uktāni</foreign> in <foreign>pada</foreign> a of the verse, I emend <foreign>pavarahani ṅhulun</foreign> to <foreign>pavarah ri ṅhulun</foreign>, as demanded by the context: the Goddess is referring to the Lord’s speech. Compare <foreign>pavarah bhaṭāra ri ṅhulun</foreign> in the preceding dyad.</note> according to the Lord, the adept, if he knows that all the deities are the body of the <foreign>maṇḍala</foreign>, surely he will not be born again.</p><p rend="stanza" n="3">[Those who] constantly perform all <foreign type="normal">mudrā</foreign>s and acts of worship, and the prescribed ritual actions  [along with] gnosis reach<note>I take <foreign>prāpyante</foreign> to be an Aiśa use of passive for the active <foreign>prāpṇuvanti</foreign>.</note> the Supreme Śiva.
</p>

<p>Another [speech of the Lord] was as follows: all the <foreign>mudrā</foreign>s and acts of worship,  and all the ritual actions, they have to be performed by the yogin daily. The Leader among Yogins, having performed those actions, reaches the station of the Lord Paramaśiva.<note>This statement is difficult to reconcile with the context of this as well as the preceding chapter, which either criticize ritual practice or prescribe it together with gnosis to obtain release. Perhaps this inconsistency is intended, as in the next dyad the Goddess hints at some  contradictions found in the Tantras.</note>

</p><p type="ledinnernote" n="4"><foreign>All the prescribed acts have likewise been proclaimed  in the Śaiva Tantras [as leading to] reincarnation</foreign>. All the <foreign>mudrā</foreign>s have to be taught again in like manner, [i.e.] causing reincarnation,  here in  the Holy Siddhānta  to me.<note>The position of <foreign>ri ṅhulun</foreign> (‘to me’) at the end of the clause, far from <foreign>varahakna pva ya muvah</foreign>, is odd. It could also be translated as ‘according to me’.</note> <foreign>Tell me, o God of gods: is this true, or is it false?</foreign> With your permission, o Lord, who is wrong, and who is right?<note>Notably, the commentator glossed the two Sanskrit interrogative pronouns <foreign>kiṁ</foreign>, meaning ‘what, why, how’, etc., or being used, like here, to mark a question, as the Old Javanese <foreign>syapa</foreign>, meaning ‘who’.</note> 


</p><p type="ledinnernote" n="5"><foreign>The state of the Supreme Lord is the knowledge. Has not [this been told to be] such by Yourself—Śiva?</foreign> The principle of the Lord Paramaśiva embodies the knowledge.<note>I have diagnostically emended <foreign>māknāthava</foreign> to <foreign>makāvak prajña</foreign> in order to obtain a gloss that closely reflects the first <foreign>pada</foreign> (cf. the occurrence of <foreign>makāvak</foreign> and <foreign>pāvak</foreign> in dyad 8.7).</note> according to your words. <foreign>Being difficult to obtain in the Śaiva Tantras</foreign>.

The speech of the Goddess being such, <foreign>God spoke</foreign>:
 
</p><p type="ledinnernote" n="6">‘<foreign>The<seg cert="low">Lord</seg> [state of the] Supreme Śiva has been told to me before by Śiva</foreign>.<note>I emend <foreign>śiṣyena</foreign> (which is not glossed in the exegesis) to <foreign>śivena</foreign>—the active construction <foreign>bhaṭāra paramaśivāmarah ṅhulun</foreign> seems to reflect the passive <foreign>mām eva kathitaṁ ... śivena</foreign>.</note> Indeed, Lord Paramaśiva spoke to me, when he said that <foreign>mudrā</foreign>s and so on [lead to] reincarnation’.

<p>The ritual, asceticism, observances, prescribed conduct, the right order of the prescribed regimen are as follows: they are true, o Goddess. They should be known [as being] thus: intelligent,<note>Here <foreign>guṇa</foreign>, which I have translated as ‘intelligent’, responds to <foreign>jñāna</foreign> in the verse. While OJED s.v. <foreign>guṇa</foreign> and <foreign>maguṇa</foreign> does not list any compatible meanings (except the marginally pertinent ‘talented, expert, capable’), in the Buddhist prose text SHP f. 21r we find an instance of <foreign>kaguṇan</foreign> occurring next to, and apparently as a near-synonym of, <foreign>kavidagdha</foreign>, <foreign>kaprajña</foreign>, and <foreign>kajñāna</foreign>. In any case, the attribution of <foreign>guṇa</foreign>, as well as the locution <foreign>māri vruḥ</foreign> in the next clause, to the rituals etc.  rather than their human performers seems odd to me.</note> and also [as that which has] given up knowledge.

Perhaps one should rather translate it as ‘excellent’ (as a predicate of <foreign>śūnyaniṅ śarīra</foreign>), in the light of the form <foreign>amalivat</foreign> ‘to a high degree’ (OJED s.v.) and Modern Balinese  <foreign>ngaliwat</foreign>, ‘pass, draw past, excel, surpass’.</note> Certainly [he] crosses over into the emptiness of the body if his manner of recognising is thus.

<p>As follows is another [outcome]: happiness is obtained by the ascetic, any objects of the senses [like] garments etc., whether he lives in a forest or in a town.

Because the context is that of the reviling of the scripture, already mentioned in the preceding dyads, I have diagnostically emended <foreign>nāsike</foreign> to <foreign>nāstike</foreign>, which I take to be a reference to the atheistic or materialistic doctrine.

This conduct is observance <foreign type="normal">(vrata)</foreign>, moral precept is virtue <foreign type="normal">(dharma)</foreign>.
</p>


<p>The basic essentials<note>The word <foreign>simpәn</foreign>(<foreign>iṅ</foreign>) here seems to be used in the same sense as <foreign>saṅsipta</foreign>(<foreign>niṅ</foreign>). cf. 11.47.</note> of the modes of being of the holy Siddhānta are as follows. It is a division of the <foreign>praṇava</foreign>. <hi rend="italic" type="title">siddha</hi> is the reverend Sadāśiva, <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is the reverend Paramaśiva.<note>I have emended  <foreign>saṅ hyaṅ siddhānta sadāśiva sira</foreign> to <foreign>siddha saṅ hyaṅ sadāśiva sira| anta saṅ hyaṅ paramaśiva sira</foreign> in order to restore the structure of the exegesis, making it symmetrical with that of dyads 11.88–90, and to more accurately reflect the contents of the verse.</note></p><p rend="stanza" n="88"><hi rend="italic" type="title">siddha</hi> <foreign>is declared to be Rudra</foreign>. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> <foreign>is the God Sadāśiva</foreign>.
</p>

<p>Another [division] is as follows: <hi rend="italic" type="title">siddha</hi> is the reverend Rudra, <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is Sadāśiva.</p><p rend="stanza" n="89"><hi rend="italic" type="title">siddha</hi> <foreign>is declared to be the Action</foreign>, <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> <foreign>is known as the Knowledge</foreign>.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic" type="title">siddha</hi> is the Power of Action, <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is the Power of Knowledge.</p><p rend="stanza" n="90"><hi rend="italic" type="title">siddha</hi> <foreign>is to be known as Pervasion, while</foreign> <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> <foreign>as Sovereignty</foreign>.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic" type="title">siddha</hi> is the Power of Pervasion, <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is the Power of Sovereignty.</p><p rend="stanza" n="91"><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is to be known as Rudra, <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> as Īśvara. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is taught to be Śiva. The praṇava is one only.
</p>

<p>The mode of being of the holy Siddhānta is threefold. <hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is Rudra. <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> ia Īśvara. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is Śiva. The <foreign>praṇava</foreign> is a single reality.</p><p rend="stanza" n="92"><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is known as the flank of the embodiment, while <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is the heart. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is taught as the head. [Thus] is proclaimed to be the <foreign>praṇava</foreign>.
</p>

<p>The reverend Rudra is the embodiment. Īśvara is the heart. The reverend Śiva is the head. Thus is the mode of being of the holy Siddhānta in the body of the practitioner.</p><p rend="stanza" n="93"><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is said to be Bhūḥ, while <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> the Bhuvaḥ. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is the Svar. [Such] is the reality called Siddhānta by name.
</p>

<p>Here is its other mode of being:</p><p rend="stanza" n="94"><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is to be known as the Earth, <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is the Space. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is taught as the heaven. [This is what] is called Siddhānta by name.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is Earth. <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is Space. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is heaven. [Such] is the mode of being of the threefold world.</p><p rend="stanza" n="95"><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is in the right side of the nose. <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is in the left side of the nose. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is the reality in the tip of the nose. [This is what] is called Siddhānta by name.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is the right side of the nose. <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is the left side of the nose. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is the tip of the nose.</p><p rend="stanza" n="96"><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is in the right eye. <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is in the left eye. Know <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> to be the third eye.<note>As suggested by the context as well as the Old Javanese gloss, <foreign>trinayanam</foreign> here is intended as having the meaning of ‘third eye’ (i.e., the invisible one placed in the forefront) instead of ‘three-eyed’.</note> [This is what] is called Siddhānta by name.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is the right eye. <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is the right eye. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is the  eye in the middle.</p>
                 <p rend="stanza" n="97"><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is in the right ear. <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is in the left ear. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is in the middle [space] between the ears. [This is what] is called Siddhānta by name.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic" type="title">si</hi> is in the right ear. <hi rend="italic" type="title">ddha</hi> is in the ear in the left. <hi rend="italic" type="title">anta</hi> is in the middle between the left and right ear.</p>


<p><foreign>Thus ends the Storehouse of the Worlds</foreign>, <foreign>the Supreme Secret Doctrine</foreign>, <foreign>the Scripture of the Siddhānta-Gnosis</foreign>, <foreign>the Teaching of Śiva</foreign>.</p>
