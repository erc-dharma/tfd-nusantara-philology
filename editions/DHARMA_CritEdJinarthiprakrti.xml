            <p n="1.1">Such are the characteristics of the Buddha in Mahayana
               Buddhism-keep them in mind! The monk has a perfect appearance
               with all the external distinguishing marks, fully determined
               in his heart. He has a bald pate, a bracelet and rosary, a
               sash,a set of monk's robes, resplendent and of bright colour, a
               belt, and a meditation cloth -everything according to the rules.</p>
            <p>
               I.2 That is what is called the bald pate: the monk sets his mind on
               the Dharma, attaining a pure nature; he is of an immaculate
               disposition; he has a knowledge which is free from diversity,
               void, free from external influences, free from [false] perception,
               admitting no doubt, and free from disturbances; he strives after
               permanence [of these qualities]. The bald pate has such a
               meaning. He always keeps his head clean-shaven. It is always
               shining.
               I.3 Knowledge is comprehension of how to conduct inhaling and
               exhaling, namely of Pral)a etc. -a mental effort. Furthermore it
               is comprehension of their circumvolation in the human body as
               a current, continuosly rotating like a wheel. Besides, it
               ceaselessly causes their appearance for the welfare of human
               beings. Such is this rosary. The true teacher does not take it off.
               I.4 Free from undue activities the mind bestows welfare on all
               mankind. First of all he should appease the gods, constantly.
               The sages also he should faithfully attend upon for the happiness
of human beings.
This is the bracelet. The monk does not part with it if he wishes
to experience voidness.
1.5 Intellectual activity, like the sun's radiance, brightly spreads over
all true traditional doctrines. One should strive to scorch the instances
of dusk and darkness, all the Six Enemies, pursuit of
wealth, improper desire, false words, and the Ten Great
Anguishes. These will be annihilated and will disappear in confusion.
Such is the sash. Surely, the monk who seeks happiness
guards it.
I. 6 Knowledge is like a clear sky from which clouds and mist are
dispelled. It is comprehension of all specific doctrines, especially
of the sublime path of the Buddha. One is aware of the Lord
Buddha's presence in the human body as well as of the goddess
as His spouse. This is the set of monk's robes. It cannot become
worn out by washing nor can it be reduced to ashes by fire.
I. 7 Knowledge is comprehension of how to realize the voidness of
everything existing as far as it is characterized by the Dharma. It
firmly tightens all doctrines into oneness as well as the course
through the human body. Moreover, [through it] the five organs
of perception are not bound to external objects nor are they
bound to any undue activity.
Such is the belt with regard to the ultimate doctrine, but it is hidden
in the mind.
I.8 Insight is comprehension of the entry of esoteric knowledge and
superior yoga-it implies a powerful minC:. Every way of worshipping
the gods as well as the series of food-offerings one
should know, all forms of ritual worship and every kind of
religious instruction, and, finally, the incantations, formularies,
and eulogies. This is the meditation cloth. Surely, it wards off
instances of ritual wrongdoing.
I. 9 Correct application of knowledge implies constant performing
of worship and praise of the Lord Buddha. Not bound to such
occupations as sleep, etc., one should heed each of the Three
Aims, fully awake. Willing to suffer difficulties, without an immediate
profit or an evident urge, one executes the Dharma,
excellent in its triple form. This is called the sawit for the wise
who seeks voidness.
I. 10 One's worship is consistent in all characteritics. There is worship
in all one's doings and dealings: all kinds of words, sweet
and for the benefit of others, are like incantations, always consistent;
all one's thoughts are the practice of muttering prayers,
counting the three winds and the three jewels. All one's activities
are impelled by yoga for the sake of becoming an excellent
yogi.
1.11 One's behavior eases the beholder as if it were a flower, always
fresh. All one's words emit wisdom like the sweet-smelling perfumes
spreading scent all around. One's special knowledge of
the Buddha are the rice-grains, constantly strewn. One's
knowledge, spotless, unwavering, and pure is like sacrificial
butter. This is the beautiful food-offering to the gods.
1.12 That is the reason why the monk is fully aware of the double
nature of liberation. He should have a clear view of the essentials,
everything belonging to the doctrine, which the Buddhist
monk pursues. Only knowledge, especially of the Buddha,
one should know, not moving away from it nor having doubts
on it. Such he should be, unconcerned with behaviour as if he
were confused with regard to the true characteristics.
1.13 These are the observances, each of them to be practised by the
monk who strives after happines. They are the Six Perfections,
widely known and to be practised. In the first place charity,
next moral conduct, then patience together with energy and
meditation - know these! - and finally wisdome. One should
keep them in mind.
Such is the classification of charity:
1.14 One's thoughts are unconcerned with material goods,
especially palmwine, cooked rice, and other nourishments.
Futher one should give away one's wife, even one's son or
daughter, if somebody wants them. One's own blood, flesh,
one's liver even one's own eyes are to be given away if
somebody 'wants them. Such is the Perfection of Charity. This
one should know as the first.
1.15 Protecting the Buddhist teachings, avowin~ ~~e rules ~f the
order of )earning, not indulging in undue acttv1ttes-th_at 1s the
triple form of correct behaviour aiming at the _hap~1~ess of
other people "Abstention from transgression against hvmg ?eings"
-from this and the others one shoul~ hold aloof, f1rst
and for all. Such-mind you!-is the Perfection of Moral Con-
1.16
duct by which people find constant happiness. .
One's thoughts should be like honey poured upon with honey
when people grieve him. They should be unchangin~, i_mmovable,
pure, and clear like a cloudless sky, eagerly w'.sh'.ng
to bestow happiness on a mind afflicted by distress,_ ~1shmg
happiness for the mind. The Perfection of Patience this 1s called.
One should always keep to it.
1.17 Without getting tired of the triple form one incessantly effects
good karma. In the daytime one sweeps clean, and constan~ly
studies, worships, and writes. At night one stays awake ~1th
yoga, muttering prayers, meditation,. ~ors~ip, an~ eulogies.
This is the Perfection of Energy-know 1t! It 1s the highroad for
one who strives after voidness. . .
1.18 Knowledge unites one's own body with all t~e-other hvm~ be~
ings. (Reflecting:] "My own body is the ongm of all bemgs,
yes, my body represents the living beings" he should there~or_e
love and endure the living beings, both high and low. This ts
the Perfection called 'Meditation'. It offers a sure way to
heaven.
1.19 Knowledge is comprehension of the past, the future, and the
present; also of all specific doctrines, ordinations, and the
complete body of sacred texts, of all external and internal
types of yoga, and of the gods of the quarters and the intermediate
quarters. This is the Perfection of Wisdom. One
should stick to it in the proper manner: it is the choice of the
observances.

225
One should, first of all, stick to the Six Perfections in one's
quest for voidness. The Lord Buddha shows a clear love for
the one who has absorbed them in his mind because they are
the gist of [all] particular texts, the core of [all] doctrines-so
the Buddhist monk proclaims. Non-duality of knowledge is the
paramount feature of the goddess as the Supreme Cause.
There is yet another group of Perfections, four in line, the socalled
'Abodes of Brahma', solid. [They are:] love, and compassion
together with joy, and followed by equanimity. Such
are the Six Perfections together with the [four] 'Abodes of
Brahma'. These are the Perfections, actually ten in number.
Before one's eyes they are the compassion of the Lord Budha.
Such is the import of love: the active mind effects happiness
for all mankind. Next, compassion is the active mind feeling
pain at the sight of sorrowful people. Further, joy is the active
mind experiencing happiness at the sight of happy people.
Pure feelings towards the affairs of others, no desire for personal
gain -that is equanimity according to the Buddhist
monk.
Now, we must not forget the human as the earth. The seas and
the mountains are the most excellent features of the body.
[The body] is a stable support in one's quest for liberation,
because as such it is nearby the abode of the gods.
Such is the arrangement of the body according to the sea:
One's limitless desire-the deep waters. One's troublesome
hate-the coral-reefs hard to pass. One's overwhelming,
restless delusion-the big waves.
U.3 One's deceit not leaving anything behind-the ferocious
sharks. One's envy, sheer poison-the sea-snakes, extremely
poisonous. One's jeaJousy-the sandbanks overgrown with
sea-weed and very troublesome. The Three Stains-the heavy
surf.
TI.4 Passion and mental darkness-the restlessly heaving waves.
One's anger-the raging gusts of the wind. The five senses
are like the rains with gales and squalls. One's shallows
knowledge-the taste of salt water, all around present.
II. 5 One's profound knowledge is a means of destroying these big
troubles. One's insight becomes the extensive Ocean of Milk.
This is churned with the mountain par excellence, the linggamonument,
Mt. Himawan. How could it be used to churn
with?
II. 6 This rosary is all-conquering by its composition: it is like the
host of the gods at the churning with the mountain-lingga.
Such is the cord, the most excellent spirituald quality,
resembling a snake as a means of churning by the host of the
gods.
II. 7 The churning by the host of the gods is rewarding for you:
knowledge of the [Ten] Perfections [results], the outcome of
which is a void [mind]. The goddess SrT appears first, unfolding
herself in all splendour. She has the nature of ambrosia
which will shortly be found.
II. 8 At ease and free from the realm of senses is the 'Milk
Ocean-mind', void. The three winds and the [three] jewels
have come to a rest. They are now unmoving and fixed. Now
one views the excellent Lord, the Buddha. It is a mirage,
however splendid, because He has a transcendental body.
II. 9 Before one's eyes He [manifests Himself] as ambrosia, clear
and pure. This is the drink of which He is the essence. Surely,
one now escapes death and the infirmities of old age. Indeed,
the Eight Qualities are now always pursued, carefully.
II.10 Such is the arrangement of the body according to the seafeatures.
The arrangement of the body as a mountain is as
follows: The head is the top of the body~mountain. One's feet
are the foot of the mountain according to the body-features.
II.11 The Group of Six-the inaccessible shrubs and deep ravines.
The tigers, lions, and bears-the Three Stains, very
ferocious.The wicked thrist-the rocky slopes with poisonous
snakes. Passion and mental darkness-the rains with thunder
and squalls.
227
II.12 Here one should resort to in one's quest for siddha-hood.
Shattered and cleared away are the shrubs of one's heart set
in self-control. Knowledge of the highly superior doctrine
serves as a sharp axe. Discernment of the Dharma is the
cleared spot meant to lay out rice-fields.
Il.13 These one should burn down by mental concentration, hot as
the sun. Indeed, all the shurbs on one's body are now burnt
down. Now the stains of one's own mind are completely clean
and purified. Constantly the ploughing goes on wit observances,
worship, and incantations.
Il.14 Next one should plant with yoga and meditation. Remove the
tall grasses and snakes by proper conduct. Clear knowledge is
the watering [ as refreshing as] the moon at the end of the day.
Then knowledge of the Buddha sprouts, which one should
constantly cultivate.
Il.15 Manifest are the fruits, namely one's seeing of the Lord Buddha.
Lasting He is as one's food to subsist on. Pleasant is
one's union with the Lord. Then one is a siddha. A Siddha
one is called who has attained liberation.
Ill.1 This is the chain of causes which one should know in the
beginning, and such are effects, durable, which one should
know at the end: the arrangement of the Lord Buddha's body
pervading the complete phenomenal world, gross as well as
minute or subtle; the Eight Powers are at one's disposal at will.
Ill.2 This then is what is calledd the aim. It is no use to discuss it
any further because it is the quintessence of cause and effect
which one pursues. With unblurred vision one views.
Knowledge appears in an absolute way, nearby the Lord Who
is all-knowing and enlightening.
Here ends the Monk's ABC, a Mahayana poem.
