As regards what are called the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu (saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian), all people should exert themselves <supplied reason="subaudible">to follow them</supplied>. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu.</p>
     <p n="2" corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments (saṅ hyaṅ dasakrəta), which must be adhered to by all people. Anyone who starts to uphold the holy instructions of the accomplishments (sasana krəta), is destined to be long-lived, to be of long youth, to have success in paddy fields (kuras), to have success in cultivation, to stand firm, to win in battle — all people [who do so] will be youthful.</p>
      <p n="3" corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: [their are] the shadows of the ten holy virtues (saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila), the reflections of the ten holy paths (saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga), the manifestations of the ten sense organs (dasa-indriya), what is needed to make the mundane world and the present world prosperous.</p> 
      <p n="4" corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the mundane world prosperous: roads being well-lit, plantations being large — most importantly — [but also] the side [yard] being clean, the front yard being well-lit. Moreover, the house being full, the rice barn is full, the chicken coop being full, the dry rice-field being cultivated, the tap [of palm trees] being protected. The result is a life full of vitality, a long-lasting health, youthfulness of the ruler (saṅ mavaṅ rat). Even in the mundane [world], grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes — all grown with fresh green leaves (hejo lembok), all trees bearing fruit, falling fertile rains, growing seasonal crops; [those] will bring life for many people. That is what is called the holy instructions of accomplishment (saṅ hyaṅ sasana krəta) in the mundane world. </p>
