         <div corresp="#skk_01">
<p corresp="#skk_01.01">Here, as follows, is what will be taught by the holy man: the way (de) of one who searches weal.* As regards what are called the hermits’ holy precepts for society (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian</foreign>)*, all people should exert themselves [to follow them]. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the hermits’ holy precepts for society.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-krəta</foreign>), which must be adhered to by all people. Anyone who starts to uphold the holy instructions of the accomplishments (<foreign>sasana krəta</foreign>), is destined to be long-lived, to be of long youth,* to have success in paddy fields (<foreign>kuras</foreign>)*, to have success in cultivation*, to stand firm*, to win in battle — all people [who do so] will be youthful*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation* of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: [their are] the shadows of the ten holy virtues (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila</foreign>), the reflections of the ten holy paths (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga</foreign>), the manifestations of the ten sense faculties (<foreign>dasa-indriya</foreign>), what is needed to make* the distant world and the near world* prosperous.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the wide world prosperous: having well-lit roads, plantations being large, well developed and productive (<foreign>paka pradana</foreign>)*, having clean yards, having well-lit front yards*, also having filled houses, filled rice barns, filled chicken coops, cultivated dry rice-fields, protected taps [of palm trees]. The result is a life full of vitality: having a long-lasting health, having youthful rulers (<foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign>)*. Even* in the wide [world]: having grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes; having fresh green (<foreign>hejo lembok</foreign>) plants*, having all trees bearing fruit, having fertile rains*, having grown seasonal crops; [those] will bring life for people in general. That is what is called the holy instructions of the accomplished one (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ sasana krəta</foreign>) in the wide world.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.05">These are the ten accomplishments, considered as the shadow of the ten holy virtues. It is the reflection of the ten paths, the manifestation of the ten sense faculties.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.06">This is its explanation. Ears should not listen randomly [to a discussion]*, if it is not fit to be listened to. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune (<foreign>mala</foreign>), the payment (<foreign>lunas</foreign>)* is punishment [in] hell. But if they are used appropriately, then the result, (obtained) from the ears, is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.07">Eyes should not watch randomly [any event], if it is not fit to be watched. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if they are used appropriately, then the result of watching is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.08">The skin should not be used jerkingly*, due to hot and cold. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the skin is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.09">The tongue should not be wrong [in] what is tasted. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the tongue is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.10">The nose should not smell wrongly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the nose is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.11">The mouth should not speak randomly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the mouth is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.12">The hands should not grasp randomly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But they are used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the hands is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.13">The feet should not step randomly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if they are used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the feet is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.14">The anus should not be used rumblingly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the anus is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.15">The vulva and the penis should not be used for seducing*, for [this] is the gate of misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the vulva and the penis is considered best. This is what is called the ten accomplishments. If the ten gates are completely used appropriately, the behavior of all people will be good, let alone the behavior of His Majesty the king*.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_02">
<p corresp="#skk_02.01">The following are called the ten devotions (<foreign>dasa-prəbakti</foreign>)*: first, a child devoted to the father; 2, a wife devoted to [her] husband; 3, a servant devoted to the officers (<foreign>pacandaan</foreign>)*; 4, a pupil devoted to [his] master; 5, a farmer devoted to the soldier*; 6, a soldier devoted to the minister; 7, a minister is devoted to the one who <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>*; 8, the one who naṅganan devoted to the governor; 9, the governor devoted to the king; 10, the king devoted to the gods; the gods devoted to the ancestors. They are called the ten devotions. 10.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_03">
<p corresp="#skk_03.01">This is what should be practiced, the message from the true sage. ‘<foreign>Oṅ</foreign>, [I give] homage to Śiva! My veneration [goes] to the Holy Five <foreign>tathagatas</foreign>!’ <foreign>Pañca</foreign> means five, <foreign>tata</foreign> means speech, <foreign>gata</foreign> means passion*. Those ones should be well maintained, all of them. The five syllables (<foreign>pañcaksara</foreign>) are the masters of men. The meaning is: the five syllables are manifest, being  seen, experienced*, observed, [and] perceived by the senses. The master is the one to be asked by the people. That is why they are called the masters of men. As for ignorance*, [it exists] since the world exists.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.02">This is the “evidence” for it, that is the five spheres of activity (<foreign>pañca-byapara</foreign>): earth, water, fire, wind and ether. Words of the great holy man: “They are the substances of our [bodies]; the skin is the earth, the blood [and] the saliva are the water, the eyes are the light, the bones are the wind, the head is the ether. It (the skin) is called the earth in the body*. The reason why they are compared to world authorities, is that they take shape* as the leader (<foreign>prabu</foreign>), the elder (<foreign>rama</foreign>), the hermit, the ritual expert (<foreign>disi</foreign>)*, and the sailor”.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.03">These are the five sons (<foreign>pañca-putra</foreign>): <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Maṅukuhan is the earth, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Katuṅ Maralah is the water, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Karuṅ Kalah is the fire, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Sandaṅ Grәba is the wind, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Vrәti Kandayun is the ether.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.04">These are the five <foreign>kusika</foreign>s*: <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Kusika on the mountain, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Garga in the swamp, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Mestri on Mount Mahameru, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Purusa in Mandiri, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Patañjala in Panjulan*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.05">If the holy five sections (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ vuku lima</foreign>)* are taken into account altogether, the earth would be in harmony, all [its] quarters of space. All quarters of space are east (<foreign>purba</foreign>), south (<foreign>daksina</foreign>), west (<foreign>pasirma</foreign>)*, north (<foreign>utara</foreign>), center (<foreign>madya</foreign>).</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.06"><foreign>Purba</foreign>is the east, the abode of the god Iswara, whose color is white. <foreign>Daksina</foreign>is the south, the abode of the god Brahma, whose color is red. <foreign>Pasirma</foreign>is the west, the abode of the god Mahadéwa, whose color is yellow. <foreign>Utara</foreign>is the north, the abode of the god Wisnu, whose color is black. <foreign>Madya</foreign>is the center, the abode of the god Siwa, whose color is multifarious. [That is] the reason why the five sacred sections (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ vuku lima</foreign>) in the universe are like that.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.07">These are the five sections in [the case of] the great scholar. The esoteric teaching is experienced by the one who is conscious (<foreign>si tutur</foreign>); asceticism is experienced by the one who is pure (<foreign>si liṅlaṅ</foreign>); posture is experienced by the one who is firm (<foreign>si pagəh</foreign>); perception is experienced by the one who is capable (<foreign>sy asəmbava</foreign>); liberation is experienced by the one who shares without receiving a share, who limits without being limited. The five sections in [the case of] the great scholar are like that.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.08">As follows are the causes of accomplishment: they are the five gods, all embodying* your name, all watching your form. But if (the names and forms) are not guarded, as if crooked meets its crooked, straight meets its straight. This is how it is: it is by human actions that it becomes accomplished, by human actions that it becomes good.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_04">
<p corresp="#skk_04.01">These are the acts of the servant, every path taken by us as servants. The act means intellect [and] mode of conduct. Every path taken means: be fearful*, be strong*, be respectful, be courteous, in behavior, in attitude*, in action, in speech, especially when in front of His Majesty the king.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.02">We should be faithful in service, in order to wipe out the ten defilements (<foreign>dasa-kalesa</foreign>), so that the impurity leading to sin will be annihilated, [and] heaven will be obtained*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.03">If [you are] excessive* in practicing the acts of the servant, that is worse than a monkey (<foreign>usyat</foreign>)* occupying a hill, performing penance on the top of the mountain, for it is forbidden to perform penance on an elephant mound [or] a lion mound, near a great danger*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.04">These are the actions of man that will be of use to all people. We should not fail to follow the hermits’ holy precepts for society! If* we wish to be free from the five forms of reincarnation (pañca-gati saṅsara), we should not be deceitful (carut)*, should not have a habit of laziness*, should not deceive ourselves. Deceiving ourselves means: what is present is considered absent, what is absent is considered present, what is true* is considered not so, what is not so is considered true — so that* his mind is scheming, pretending, deceiving, hurting. That is the explanation of being deceitful to ourselves*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.05">Being deceitful to other people means: plucking without asking permission, taking without asking, picking without requesting, let alone looting, thieving, plundering, robbing, everything that counts as impudent and deceitful. Those are called being deceitful to other people.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.06">And also infiltrating, grabbing, pilfering, seizing, groping, sneaking, let alone hanging around with a host, with a dignitary*, let alone* with one's own master. That should even less be done, be practiced by the servants.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.07">Do not fail to practice polite, respectful, and refined words*, to be humble and well-mannered to fellow humans, to family and relatives*, let alone to our master. We should use [our] feet to sit politely, [our] hands to pay respect*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.08">If we talk with a nobleman, with a gusti, with the lover of someone else, with a forbidden woman, let alone with our master; if we are employed [by them], [we] should not be angry* in our minds, let alone answer wrongly, an expression of discontent visible to our master. Don’t! It is forbidden, lest the result of asceticism fail, [and] the result of the ancestors (<foreign>cakal bakal</foreign>)* be lost! Lest the results* of hard work be lost! [We will] be met by the god of worldly misfortune, fined* by His Majesty the king.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.09">If we are not faithful to our master, for instance if we are in a sick state, if we are tired, if we are careless, [then] let’s honestly acknowledge that we have been very disgraceful*, so that we are acknowledged to be faithful in service. But if we act, we should not be weak, we should not fall short*, should not refuse* when being ordered, should not be envious [or] malicious with those engaged in the same service, especially when seeing someone who gets praise [or] gets an audience (parəkan)*; seeing someone who is favored by the master, then our thoughts may become overheated*. They should not, it is forbidden*! Its being forbidden leads to tears*, the heart wounded without being able to be cured, mantras being ineffective, intentions not becoming reality, because the holy hermits’ precepts for society  are not adhered to.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.10">Likewise, if we are <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>, do not reprimand [us] discreetly. If we are reprimanded, [we] must not fail to be devoted to the <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>*, because he is the agent (<foreign>tanda</foreign>) of His Majesty the king*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.11">If we are under orders*, [we] should not fail to maintain the Hermits’ Holy Precepts for Society, so that we are faithful to the commandments*. But as regards the one who goes north, south, west, east, he must not* <foreign>si vok cante</foreign>*, must not <foreign>si mur cante</foreign>, shall not become <foreign>si mar cante</foreign>, shall not [become] <foreign>darma cante</foreign>. Those are called four efforts (<foreign>catur-yatna</foreign>).</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.12">This is the meaning. <foreign>Si vok cante</foreign> means easily tempted by food and drink. <foreign>Si mur cante</foreign> means guilty* of participating in making those who steal, who confiscate, who deceive, spread in all directions*; it is called the wrong destination. <foreign>Si mar cante</foreign> means to take merchandise, sheets of gold and silver, [even if] it is not ordered by the commander; it is called wrong purpose. <foreign>Darma cante</foreign> means tolerant* of what is detestable to our master. He is ordered to fetch [someone], to go by foot [to pick up someone], and to kill those who are unfit for* [our] master, [but] instead he becomes more careful, because they are friends, family, and relatives. That should not be done, for what is called the wrong <foreign>binarih</foreign> (?)* is forbidden; it is called <foreign>darma cante</foreign>. Those things should not be practiced by the servants: to love the detestable, to detest the lovable. They are improper to be practiced by the servants.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.13">This is so that we obey the master, so that we are long taken as servants, so that we are always controlled* by our master: follow the hermits’ holy precepts for society! pay attention to the dignitary! If the master scolds [someone], we too should participate in scolding with the master. If the master praises [someone], we too should participate in praising with the master. If we cannot participate in praising [or] participate in criticizing* with the master, it is better that we keep quiet while devoting ourselves to the master.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.14">If we walk into the forest, [we should wear] an upper garment, a lower garment*, and a combination*. When coming to the [sea]side*, [we] should normally (<foreign>sakarajən</foreign>)* wear upper and lower garments. When not with the master, [we must] be careful about the hermits’ holy precepts for society. Their precepts are: don’t go harvesting [legumes] from other people’s small fields, from other people’s gardens, except by virtue of our having asked permission.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.15">A rope on a forest and on a garden*, wood that had been marked by a string, fruit that has been bunched together, firewood that stands ready, a covering for mushrooms, hives or nests* of various bees (<foreign>təvvan</foreign>, <foreign>odeṅ</foreign>, <foreign>ñəruan</foreign>), of wasps (<foreign>eṅaṅ</foreign>), of woodworm (<foreign>ulam</foreign>)*, a fish trap (<foreign>parakan</foreign>) — all kinds of ownership marks (<foreign>babayan</foreign>): we should not take them carelessly, let alone bring down other people’s taps. That should not be done, for it is the origin of guilt, the source of suffering and misery.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.16">If we find a road, large or small, [we should] quickly* wear loin-cloth or a combination, [as] we might be faced with <foreign>gusti</foreign>s or with <foreign>mantri</foreign>s. [We] should not fail to move to the left and bend down*. If [we meet with] <foreign>bujaṅga</foreign>s, brahmans, royal ascetics, governors, princes, rich or poor, especially <foreign>guru loka</foreign>s*, [we] should not fail to move to the left* and sit, for those are the teachers of the king.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_05">
<p corresp="#skk_05.01">Keep in mind the Hermits’ Precepts for Society, and beware of adultery*. [We should not] go and whimper about* the forbidden women of others, widowed maidens, lest we be guilty of ‘adultery of the road’; especially [we should not go and] hold hands*, sharing a seat on a tree trunk, on a couch, in a shelter (<foreign>təpas</foreign>), one with another. [It] is called ‘adultery of the seating place’. Standing face to face* by the side of the house, in the yard, one with another. It is called ‘adultery of the yard’. Answering someone who coughs, who is clearing the throat, who is expectorating, especially someone else’s mother’s* song. It is called ‘the roaring cow’ (<foreign>ləmbu aṅgala</foreign>)*. Resting on the place where the other one* has sat — on a post, on a tree, on a stone — [after] seeing her having gotten up then replacing them to lean, that is called ‘the rubbing cow’ (ləmbu aṅgasir)*. Those should be remembered, if we want to free ourselves from hell.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_05.02">And also joining together in one lodging, one residence, one shelter, one couch, with someone else’s women*, with forbidden women of someone else; it is called ‘the buffalo in one pen’ (<foreign>kəbo sapitunahan</foreign>)*. Those are the things to be kept in mind. They are called forbidden acts.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_05.03">In the same way, if we are going on a journey, we shouldn’t [do that], shouldn’t desire to be followed by the servants of someone else. If we desire to take them, we should ask their master. If they are trusted [servants], [we should] make an oath* (as to our liability) for their sickness, for their death, for their loss, [for their] passing  away and dying, in any way whatsoever, them you must take. There is no one who may be blamed*, for an oath is more eminent* than [written] law (<foreign>agama</foreign>). If they are not trusted* [servants], then we should not! If we insist on taking them, we should help them when they are sick, we should redeem them individually (? <foreign>sakadǝgdǝgna</foreign>) if they are dead or lost. All of that should be taken into account.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_06">
<p corresp="#skk_06.01">Further, as follows: if we are visited by the <foreign>same</foreign>*, <foreign>paṅuraṅ</foreign>, <foreign>dasa</foreign>, <foreign>calagara</foreign>, <foreign>upəti paṅgərəs rəma</foreign>*, our thoughts should be cheerful, we should feel as though being visited by family, relatives, younger and elder siblings, children, friends, children of younger siblings (<foreign>suvan</foreign>)*, children of elder siblings (<foreign>kaponakan</foreign>). That is the metaphor for it. But if we have things to share, [such as] food, drink, under garments, clothes [or] anything that we own*, we should feel as though making offerings and giving reception* to the ancestors and gods.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_06.02">Moreover, if we are employed [to go] to the dry rice field, to the paddy field, to the great paddy field (<foreign>seraṅ agəṅ</foreign>)*; fencing, digging a trench, putting animals into the pen, making snares, dam fishing*, fishing with a casting net, fishing with a line (?, ṅadodoger)*, fishing with drag-net (mapayaṅ), fishing with a sieve (<foreign>ñair</foreign>)*, ensnaring animals by two people (? <foreign>biñcaṅ</foreign>)* — any kind of employment for the master, we should not be displeased, we should not be temperamental*, we should not be angry* or fuss*. We should enjoy it all. We should  mean our tasks.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_07">
<p corresp="#skk_07.01">However, if we are returning home, we should not defecate on the edge of the road, by the side of the house, on its bright end, lest it be smelled by a nobleman [or] by a <foreign>gusti</foreign>, not to mention by people who do not pay attention*; lest [we] be cursed [and] blamed* by [our] mother, father [and] teachers, be opposed* by the elders, because of our reckless deeds. But if [we] obey the holy precepts, [we] defecate seven steps* from the road [and] urinate three steps from the road. May [we] not meet with criticism from other people, as we know <foreign>ulah pamali</foreign>*. The meaning is: <foreign>ulah</foreign> means sorrow, <foreign>pamali</foreign> means death.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_07.02">Furthermore, [we should] watch out for rope barriers (<foreign>gagavar</foreign>)*, the ends of snares (? <foreign>pucuk tambaluṅ</foreign>)*, as they could be court reservoirs*, forbidden enclosures, forbidden pavilions — all the more so for obstructing light*, for coming across [or] passing the king [when he is] walking about, because those are the places where offense is liable to happen.  If we enter the court, we must often look [in all directions], as it may be that we are trampling, bumping, hitting* [or] cutting a line.</p>

<p corresp="#skk_12.04">If those [actions] are not performed and [not] carried out by the humans, of low, middle, and high class, each of them is thrown into the cauldron called ‘Bull Headed Copper [Cauldron]’*. Because the human is overpowered by the Gods. <foreign>Pun</foreign>*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_12.05">Darma Pitutur spoke, reporting the words of the precursors: There is another comparison, like [when] we went to Java, [we] are unable to follow its language and its manners, we felt confused. After [we] returned home to Sunda, we were unable to speak Javanese. It felt as if we had not come [back] from a journey, “what we bought as a result of visiting was worthless”*, because of inability to follow its language.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_12.06">That is how we are, as humans, continually* descending from the unmanifest, [but] not finding the manners of the Gods, rushing to be incarnated as humans, because their appearance is silly, their behavior is ignorant, [and they are] incapable of following the acts of the ones who know. There are acts committed that are unfaithful, that are improper. [They] start to do evil, to trespass, to have affairs in secret (<foreign>bubunyan</foreign>) with younger and older relatives. That is why a woman enjoying a man who is not her husband is considered improper; a man enjoying a woman who is not his wife (? <foreign>əsi imahna</foreign>)* is [likewise] considered improper. [They] are liable to be thrown into the cauldron called ‘The Victorious Deer’ (Si Mrəga Vijaya)*, because humans prefer what is wrong.</p></div>
<div corresp="#skk_13">
<p corresp="#skk_13.01">These are the symbolic terms (<foreign>siloka</foreign>)* for the behavior of wrong people: lawless (<foreign>buraṅkak</foreign>)*, anxious (? <foreign>marende</foreign>)*, sulky (<foreign>mariris</foreign>)*, shameful (<foreign>viraṅ</foreign>). They are called the four demons. The meaning is: <foreign>buraṅkak</foreign> means shuddering. What is horrifying*, as it were, is the behavior of the person who is envious, surly, staring, coarse (?, <foreign>gasoṅ</foreign>)*, rude in speech, ugly in behavior, hot of heart. [Such behavior] is considered improper. That is what the behavior of such men is like, horrifying as it were. He becomes a demon, Durga, Durgi, the demon Kala. His place is in the dirt of the earth.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.02">The dirty soils are: hollows, clusters (? <foreign>saroṅge</foreign>)*, lime-stone cliffs (<foreign>cadas gantuṅ</foreign>), scattered stones*, gorges, swamps*, rhinoceros ponds, tree trunks upside down* and aslant (<foreign>cataṅ nuṅgaṅ cataṅ noṅgeṅ</foreign>), mine tunnels (<foreign>garuṅguṅan gareṅgeṅan</foreign>)*, dangerous lands (<foreign>saṅhar</foreign>)*, burning grounds*, [lands of] crawling animals (<foreign>varian</foreign>), hillocks, male soils (<foreign>ləmah laki</foreign>), pigsties, gutters (<foreign>kalomberan</foreign>)*, rubbish dumps, cremation grounds (<foreign>səma</foreign>)* — every kind of soil avoided.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.03">What those who are obstinate in their ugly behaviors become is like that, because the behavior of men is what gives horror*. They become every sort of horrifying thing, because they do not follow the holy instruction of the accomplished one*, because they transgress the Hermits’ Holy Precepts for Society. That is why they become horrifying. That is the meaning of <foreign>buraṅkak</foreign>.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.04"><foreign>Marende</foreign> means: being cooled down* and yet feeling hot; being given pity*, being given sympathy, being taken care of, being coddled, being given pleasures [and] enjoyments*, servants [and] slaves, and yet mistrusting [them]. It is clear that he is affected by the misery of which the field [called] Patana is full*. Its length is one <foreign>yojana</foreign>*. In the east is the Sword Tree*. One hundred thousand men are struck [by its swords] there. In the south is the Stone Mountain. One hundred thousand evil men are suffering there together. In the west are the Fire-Headed ghosts*. Humans cannot fathom how much suffering is there. In the north, there are one hundred people suffering together there, like grass-hoppers on a skewer. In the middle is the crow of the Patana*, with the Dog ghosts. Thousands of evil people are suffering there. That is the misery of those called <foreign>marende</foreign>.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.05"><foreign>Mariris</foreign> means defiled, disgusting like excrement, defiled like a reeking carcass. Such is the conduct of people who are kleptomaniac, who seize indiscriminately, or even take indiscriminately, without asking, stealing, plundering, deceiving, pilfering — all kinds of lying* to good persons. When he dies, his soul* will suffer, for one thousand [and] one hundred years afflicted by the curse of the gods. That is why birth as a human is not in sight. As for what he becomes: <foreign>koter</foreign>*, <foreign>jaṅgel</foreign>*, crop-worm*, horse-fly*, <foreign>titiṅgi</foreign>*, <foreign>jambəloṅ</foreign>*, leatherleaf slug*, <foreign>mear</foreign>*, <foreign>pacet</foreign>* (blood sucking haemadipsa), leech, <foreign>ləhəṅ</foreign>, <foreign>gərəṅ</foreign>* — everything that is despised by people in general, that is what is called <foreign>mariris</foreign>.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.06">Disgrace (<foreign>viraṅ</foreign>) means unwilling to be sincere, unwilling to truthful, unwilling to be proper, unwilling to be frank, unwilling to be polite. If his anxiety (?, <foreign>harən</foreign>)*, passion, love [or] astonishment is deceitful, [then] when he dies, his soul will meet with suffering, [i.e] a wobbly bridge, a slanting plank bridge, clashing stones. When they are made into being in the world, they become everything that is horrifying: rhinoceros, tiger, crocodile, great snake, everything that is horrifying. That is called disgrace (<foreign>viraṅ</foreign>).  So much for the four demons.</p></div>
<div corresp="#skk_14">
<p corresp="#skk_14.01">This is like a man who travels to China, spends a long time in China. [He] knows Chinese customs, Chinese habits, Chinese language, Chinese manners, Chinese etiquette. [He] meets with three [levels] of language, [namely] low, middle, and high. [He] knows all* about the speech of the king, the elder, and the hermit; is able to direct the breath, the speech, and the mind. That is the reason why [he] knows about the consciousness (<foreign>gəiṅ</foreign>), the higher consciousness (<foreign>upagəiṅ</foreign>), the ultimate consciousness (<foreign>parigəiṅ</foreign>). They are called the three forms of consciousness.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_14.02">Consciousness is [a person endowed with it] being able to taste, to drink, [and] being able to have pleasure; that is called consciousness. What is called higher consciousness is [a person endowed with it] being able to dress, able to wear clothes, able to wear a lower garment, able to wear festive attire; that is called higher consciousness. What is called ultimate consciousness is [a person endowed with it] being able to instruct, able to command, because his speech is sweet [and] fragrant*, such that the one who is commanded does not become angry, because he is touched by the impact of applying expressions with a deeper meaning (<foreign>siloka</foreign>)*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_14.03">If his words (<foreign>basana</foreign>)* are [addressed] to a youngster, [he addresses him or her as] ‘boy’ (<foreign>utun</foreign>)*, ‘girl’ (<foreign>eten</foreign>)*, ‘baby’ (<foreign>orok</foreign>), ‘my child’, ‘my little sibling’. [If they are addressed] to an elder, [he addresses him or her as] ‘my elder brother’*, ‘my elder nephew or niece’, ‘my elder sister’, ‘my senior’, and ‘my grandfather’. His exclamations* are: are ‘be well!’ (<foreign>sumaṅər</foreign>), ‘what a pity!’ (<foreign>tətəiṅ amat</foreign>). As numerous are the ten pacifying acts*, namely: being virtuous*, reverent (<foreign>nama</foreign>)*, sympathetic*, forgiving*, loving, compassionate, generous*, gentle*, tranquil, ingratiating. That is why someone who is given an order is happy [and] joyful, bright [and] shining. That is called the ultimate consciousness.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_14.04">These are the metaphors for it*: gold, silver, jewel, diamond. They are called the four holy courtesies. This is its meaning: gold means the speech which is right, accurate, clear, [applying] the formula of five syllables*. Silver means the mind which is accomplished, proper, good. Jewel means his consciousness is bright [and] shining, wide [and] broad*. Diamond means cheerfully laughing*, visibly smiling*, pleasant of heart. They are called the four courtesies.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_14.05">They are the people who originate from the pure ones among lands. The pure ones among lands are the offering place, the place of rolled offerings (? <foreign>pabuntəlan</foreign>)*, the worship place, the sturdy house (? <foreign>imah manəh</foreign>)*, the sanctuary, the temple tower, the <foreign>lingga</foreign>, the statue*, the <foreign>gaṅsa</foreign> stone (<foreign>batu gaṅsa</foreign>)*, land with statues, where human figures are created [and] sweeping [is performed]. So many are all lands which are maintained, waters that are strained [and] purified. It is indeed a good person, a kind person. He is an accomplished person. The one who is considered to originate from the pure ones among lands is aware of the holy precepts, heeding the advice of mother, father, grandfather and great-grandfather, knowing the teachings of the great scholars, upholding the words of the accomplished ones.</p></div>
<div corresp="#skk_15">
<p corresp="#skk_15.01">This is the account of the ancient ones who instated the holy instructions of the accomplished ones: the deified ancestor Déwaraja, the deified ancestor Rawung Langit, the deified ancestor at Medang, the deified ancestor at Menir*. They are called the four accomplished ones. That is why in the present, men who are aware of the holy supreme <foreign>dharma</foreign>, knowledgeable about the secret teachings of men, they are called esoteric men*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_15.02">If they die, their soul will find a beautiful heaven, finding daytime that does not turn into night, joy that does not turn into sorrow, heaven that does not turn into into [the hell of] sinners, pleasure that does not turn into pain, good that does not turn into into bad, fortunate that does not turn into unfortunate, subtle that does not turn into gross, being gone that does not turn into being present, ancestors that do not turn into gods. That is what is called the supreme liberation*.</p></div>
<div corresp="#skk_16">
<p corresp="#skk_16.01">Likewise are the people in the present*. Compare us taking a bath, the choices of the water to be touched by us are only two: the one which is turbid and the one which is clear. Likewise are the behaviors of people, two (types) being put into practice: the bad and the good. Likewise are the people: the cause of their being treated badly is that bad behavior of theirs. Likewise are the people: the cause of their being treated well is that good behavior of theirs. That is why people are bad by their behavior, why they are good by their behavior*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_16.02">Water is like that, insofar as the choices of it are said to be two. Water that is refreshing and clear is the holy supreme <foreign>dharma</foreign>, that is what is practiced by the great scholars. Water that is haunted and turbid is the emotional conduct (<foreign>rasa-carita</foreign>), which is practiced by all the <foreign>viku</foreign>s for whom the <foreign>nec plus ultra</foreign> is worldly*. That is why it (i.e., water) is comparable to consciousness* as well as unconsciousness. Consciousness is aware and mindful of memories without turning into forgetfulness. It is the root of a favorable rebirth, the cause of a prosperous earth*. Unconsciousness is forgetfulness [and] confusion, not endowed with memory. It is the cause of destruction, the starting point of the Kali era, the base of deviation, the root of falsehood*. It is the cause of people going to hell. That should not be taken as truth by those who wish to be sincere.</p></div>

<p corresp="#skk_17.02">These are the group of three in the distant [world]*: Wisnu is considered as king, Brahma is considered as elder, Iswara is considered a hermit. It is the reason why the three threads are the support of the world, [while] the group of three are the life of the world. They are considered as the three threads for all people. [We] should hold [them] up, hold [them] fast until they are straight, true, evident, [and] present*. The reason why the world is prosperous, why the earth is affluent, is because the actions of people are well maintained.</p>

Formerly, the scholars, together with the divine king who were firm in making the world prosperous, so that the north, south, west [and] east — everything which is held by the earth [and] covered by the sky — prospered, all beings are alive, all of them*.</p></div>
