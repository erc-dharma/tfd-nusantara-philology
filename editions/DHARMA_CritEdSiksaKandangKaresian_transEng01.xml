         <div corresp="#skk_01">
<p corresp="#skk_01.01">Here, as follows, is what will be taught by the holy man: the way (de) of one who searches weal.* As regards what are called the hermits’ holy precepts for society (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian</foreign>)*, all people should exert themselves [to follow them]. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the hermits’ holy precepts for society.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-krəta</foreign>), which must be adhered to by all people. Anyone who starts to uphold the holy instructions of the accomplishments (<foreign>sasana krəta</foreign>), is destined to be long-lived, to be of long youth,* to have success in paddy fields (<foreign>kuras</foreign>)*, to have success in cultivation*, to stand firm*, to win in battle — all people [who do so] will be youthful*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation* of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: [their are] the shadows of the ten holy virtues (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila</foreign>), the reflections of the ten holy paths (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga</foreign>), the manifestations of the ten sense faculties (<foreign>dasa-indriya</foreign>), what is needed to make* the distant world and the near world* prosperous.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the wide world prosperous: having well-lit roads, plantations being large, well developed and productive (<foreign>paka pradana</foreign>)*, having clean yards, having well-lit front yards*, also having filled houses, filled rice barns, filled chicken coops, cultivated dry rice-fields, protected taps [of palm trees]. The result is a life full of vitality: having a long-lasting health, having youthful rulers (<foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign>)*. Even* in the wide [world]: having grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes; having fresh green (<foreign>hejo lembok</foreign>) plants*, having all trees bearing fruit, having fertile rains*, having grown seasonal crops; [those] will bring life for people in general. That is what is called the holy instructions of the accomplished one (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ sasana krəta</foreign>) in the wide world.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.05">These are the ten accomplishments, considered as the shadow of the ten holy virtues. It is the reflection of the ten paths, the manifestation of the ten sense faculties.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.06">This is its explanation. Ears should not listen randomly [to a discussion]*, if it is not fit to be listened to. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune (<foreign>mala</foreign>), the payment (<foreign>lunas</foreign>)* is punishment [in] hell. But if they are used appropriately, then the result, (obtained) from the ears, is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.07">Eyes should not watch randomly [any event], if it is not fit to be watched. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if they are used appropriately, then the result of watching is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.08">The skin should not be used jerkingly*, due to hot and cold. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the skin is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.09">The tongue should not be wrong [in] what is tasted. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the tongue is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.10">The nose should not smell wrongly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the nose is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.11">The mouth should not speak randomly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the mouth is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.12">The hands should not grasp randomly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But they are used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the hands is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.13">The feet should not step randomly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if they are used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the feet is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.14">The anus should not be used rumblingly. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the anus is considered optimal.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.15">The vulva and the penis should not be used for seducing*, for [this] is the gate of misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result (obtained) from the vulva and the penis is considered best. This is what is called the ten accomplishments. If the ten gates are completely used appropriately, the behavior of all people will be good, let alone the behavior of His Majesty the king*.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_02">
<p corresp="#skk_02.01">The following are called the ten devotions (<foreign>dasa-prəbakti</foreign>)*: first, a child devoted to the father; 2, a wife devoted to [her] husband; 3, a servant devoted to the officers (<foreign>pacandaan</foreign>)*; 4, a pupil devoted to [his] master; 5, a farmer devoted to the soldier*; 6, a soldier devoted to the minister; 7, a minister is devoted to the one who <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>*; 8, the one who naṅganan devoted to the governor; 9, the governor devoted to the king; 10, the king devoted to the gods; the gods devoted to the ancestors. They are called the ten devotions. 10.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_03">
<p corresp="#skk_03.01">This is what should be practiced, the message from the true sage. ‘<foreign>Oṅ</foreign>, [I give] homage to Śiva! My veneration [goes] to the Holy Five <foreign>tathagatas</foreign>!’ <foreign>Pañca</foreign> means five, <foreign>tata</foreign> means speech, <foreign>gata</foreign> means passion*. Those ones should be well maintained, all of them. The five syllables (<foreign>pañcaksara</foreign>) are the masters of men. The meaning is: the five syllables are manifest, being  seen, experienced*, observed, [and] perceived by the senses. The master is the one to be asked by the people. That is why they are called the masters of men. As for ignorance*, [it exists] since the world exists.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.02">This is the “evidence” for it, that is the five spheres of activity (<foreign>pañca-byapara</foreign>): earth, water, fire, wind and ether. Words of the great holy man: “They are the substances of our [bodies]; the skin is the earth, the blood [and] the saliva are the water, the eyes are the light, the bones are the wind, the head is the ether. It (the skin) is called the earth in the body*. The reason why they are compared to world authorities, is that they take shape* as the leader (<foreign>prabu</foreign>), the elder (<foreign>rama</foreign>), the hermit, the ritual expert (<foreign>disi</foreign>)*, and the sailor”.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.03">These are the five sons (<foreign>pañca-putra</foreign>): <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Maṅukuhan is the earth, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Katuṅ Maralah is the water, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Karuṅ Kalah is the fire, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Sandaṅ Grәba is the wind, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Vrәti Kandayun is the ether.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.04">These are the five <foreign>kusika</foreign>s*: <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Kusika on the mountain, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Garga in the swamp, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Mestri on Mount Mahameru, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Purusa in Mandiri, <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Patañjala in Panjulan*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.05">If the holy five sections (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ vuku lima</foreign>)* are taken into account altogether, the earth would be in harmony, all [its] quarters of space. All quarters of space are east (<foreign>purba</foreign>), south (<foreign>daksina</foreign>), west (<foreign>pasirma</foreign>)*, north (<foreign>utara</foreign>), center (<foreign>madya</foreign>).</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.06"><foreign>Purba</foreign>is the east, the abode of the god Iswara, whose color is white. <foreign>Daksina</foreign>is the south, the abode of the god Brahma, whose color is red. <foreign>Pasirma</foreign>is the west, the abode of the god Mahadéwa, whose color is yellow. <foreign>Utara</foreign>is the north, the abode of the god Wisnu, whose color is black. <foreign>Madya</foreign>is the center, the abode of the god Siwa, whose color is multifarious. [That is] the reason why the five sacred sections (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ vuku lima</foreign>) in the universe are like that.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.07">These are the five sections in [the case of] the great scholar. The esoteric teaching is experienced by the one who is conscious (<foreign>si tutur</foreign>); asceticism is experienced by the one who is pure (<foreign>si liṅlaṅ</foreign>); posture is experienced by the one who is firm (<foreign>si pagəh</foreign>); perception is experienced by the one who is capable (<foreign>sy asəmbava</foreign>); liberation is experienced by the one who shares without receiving a share, who limits without being limited. The five sections in [the case of] the great scholar are like that.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_03.08">As follows are the causes of accomplishment: they are the five gods, all embodying* your name, all watching your form. But if (the names and forms) are not guarded, as if crooked meets its crooked, straight meets its straight. This is how it is: it is by human actions that it becomes accomplished, by human actions that it becomes good.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_04">
<p corresp="#skk_04.01">These are the acts of the servant, every path taken by us as servants. The act means intellect [and] mode of conduct. Every path taken means: be fearful*, be strong*, be respectful, be courteous, in behavior, in attitude*, in action, in speech, especially when in front of His Majesty the king.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.02">We should be faithful in service, in order to wipe out the ten defilements (<foreign>dasa-kalesa</foreign>), so that the impurity leading to sin will be annihilated, [and] heaven will be obtained*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.03">If [you are] excessive* in practicing the acts of the servant, that is worse than a monkey (<foreign>usyat</foreign>)* occupying a hill, performing penance on the top of the mountain, for it is forbidden to perform penance on an elephant mound [or] a lion mound, near a great danger*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.04">These are the actions of man that will be of use to all people. We should not fail to follow the hermits’ holy precepts for society! If* we wish to be free from the five forms of reincarnation (pañca-gati saṅsara), we should not be deceitful (carut)*, should not have a habit of laziness*, should not deceive ourselves. Deceiving ourselves means: what is present is considered absent, what is absent is considered present, what is true* is considered not so, what is not so is considered true — so that* his mind is scheming, pretending, deceiving, hurting. That is the explanation of being deceitful to ourselves*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.05">Being deceitful to other people means: plucking without asking permission, taking without asking, picking without requesting, let alone looting, thieving, plundering, robbing, everything that counts as impudent and deceitful. Those are called being deceitful to other people.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.06">And also infiltrating, grabbing, pilfering, seizing, groping, sneaking, let alone hanging around with a host, with a dignitary*, let alone* with one's own master. That should even less be done, be practiced by the servants.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.07">Do not fail to practice polite, respectful, and refined words*, to be humble and well-mannered to fellow humans, to family and relatives*, let alone to our master. We should use [our] feet to sit politely, [our] hands to pay respect*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.08">If we talk with a nobleman, with a gusti, with the lover of someone else, with a forbidden woman, let alone with our master; if we are employed [by them], [we] should not be angry* in our minds, let alone answer wrongly, an expression of discontent visible to our master. Don’t! It is forbidden, lest the result of asceticism fail, [and] the result of the ancestors (<foreign>cakal bakal</foreign>)* be lost! Lest the results* of hard work be lost! [We will] be met by the god of worldly misfortune, fined* by His Majesty the king.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.09">If we are not faithful to our master, for instance if we are in a sick state, if we are tired, if we are careless, [then] let’s honestly acknowledge that we have been very disgraceful*, so that we are acknowledged to be faithful in service. But if we act, we should not be weak, we should not fall short*, should not refuse* when being ordered, should not be envious [or] malicious with those engaged in the same service, especially when seeing someone who gets praise [or] gets an audience (parəkan)*; seeing someone who is favored by the master, then our thoughts may become overheated*. They should not, it is forbidden*! Its being forbidden leads to tears*, the heart wounded without being able to be cured, mantras being ineffective, intentions not becoming reality, because the holy hermits’ precepts for society  are not adhered to.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.10">Likewise, if we are <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>, do not reprimand [us] discreetly. If we are reprimanded, [we] must not fail to be devoted to the <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>*, because he is the agent (<foreign>tanda</foreign>) of His Majesty the king*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.11">If we are under orders*, [we] should not fail to maintain the Hermits’ Holy Precepts for Society, so that we are faithful to the commandments*. But as regards the one who goes north, south, west, east, he must not* <foreign>si vok cante</foreign>*, must not <foreign>si mur cante</foreign>, shall not become <foreign>si mar cante</foreign>, shall not [become] <foreign>darma cante</foreign>. Those are called four efforts (<foreign>catur-yatna</foreign>).</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.12">This is the meaning. <foreign>Si vok cante</foreign> means easily tempted by food and drink. <foreign>Si mur cante</foreign> means guilty* of participating in making those who steal, who confiscate, who deceive, spread in all directions*; it is called the wrong destination. <foreign>Si mar cante</foreign> means to take merchandise, sheets of gold and silver, [even if] it is not ordered by the commander; it is called wrong purpose. <foreign>Darma cante</foreign> means tolerant* of what is detestable to our master. He is ordered to fetch [someone], to go by foot [to pick up someone], and to kill those who are unfit for* [our] master, [but] instead he becomes more careful, because they are friends, family, and relatives. That should not be done, for what is called the wrong <foreign>binarih</foreign> (?)* is forbidden; it is called <foreign>darma cante</foreign>. Those things should not be practiced by the servants: to love the detestable, to detest the lovable. They are improper to be practiced by the servants.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.13">This is so that we obey the master, so that we are long taken as servants, so that we are always controlled* by our master: follow the hermits’ holy precepts for society! pay attention to the dignitary! If the master scolds [someone], we too should participate in scolding with the master. If the master praises [someone], we too should participate in praising with the master. If we cannot participate in praising [or] participate in criticizing* with the master, it is better that we keep quiet while devoting ourselves to the master.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.14">If we walk into the forest, [we should wear] an upper garment, a lower garment*, and a combination*. When coming to the [sea]side*, [we] should normally (<foreign>sakarajən</foreign>)* wear upper and lower garments. When not with the master, [we must] be careful about the hermits’ holy precepts for society. Their precepts are: don’t go harvesting [legumes] from other people’s small fields, from other people’s gardens, except by virtue of our having asked permission.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.15">A rope on a forest and on a garden*, wood that had been marked by a string, fruit that has been bunched together, firewood that stands ready, a covering for mushrooms, hives or nests* of various bees (<foreign>təvvan</foreign>, <foreign>odeṅ</foreign>, <foreign>ñəruan</foreign>), of wasps (<foreign>eṅaṅ</foreign>), of woodworm (<foreign>ulam</foreign>)*, a fish trap (<foreign>parakan</foreign>) — all kinds of ownership marks (<foreign>babayan</foreign>): we should not take them carelessly, let alone bring down other people’s taps. That should not be done, for it is the origin of guilt, the source of suffering and misery.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.16">If we find a road, large or small, [we should] quickly* wear loin-cloth or a combination, [as] we might be faced with <foreign>gusti</foreign>s or with <foreign>mantri</foreign>s. [We] should not fail to move to the left and bend down*. If [we meet with] <foreign>bujaṅga</foreign>s, brahmans, royal ascetics, governors, princes, rich or poor, especially <foreign>guru loka</foreign>s*, [we] should not fail to move to the left* and sit, for those are the teachers of the king.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_05">
<p corresp="#skk_05.01">Keep in mind the Hermits’ Precepts for Society, and beware of adultery*. [We should not] go and whimper about* the forbidden women of others, widowed maidens, lest we be guilty of ‘adultery of the road’; especially [we should not go and] hold hands*, sharing a seat on a tree trunk, on a couch, in a shelter (<foreign>təpas</foreign>), one with another. [It] is called ‘adultery of the seating place’. Standing face to face* by the side of the house, in the yard, one with another. It is called ‘adultery of the yard’. Answering someone who coughs, who is clearing the throat, who is expectorating, especially someone else’s mother’s* song. It is called ‘the roaring cow’ (<foreign>ləmbu aṅgala</foreign>)*. Resting on the place where the other one* has sat — on a post, on a tree, on a stone — [after] seeing her having gotten up then replacing them to lean, that is called ‘the rubbing cow’ (ləmbu aṅgasir)*. Those should be remembered, if we want to free ourselves from hell.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_05.02">And also joining together in one lodging, one residence, one shelter, one couch, with someone else’s women*, with forbidden women of someone else; it is called ‘the buffalo in one pen’ (<foreign>kəbo sapitunahan</foreign>)*. Those are the things to be kept in mind. They are called forbidden acts.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_05.03">In the same way, if we are going on a journey, we shouldn’t [do that], shouldn’t desire to be followed by the servants of someone else. If we desire to take them, we should ask their master. If they are trusted [servants], [we should] make an oath* (as to our liability) for their sickness, for their death, for their loss, [for their] passing  away and dying, in any way whatsoever, them you must take. There is no one who may be blamed*, for an oath is more eminent* than [written] law (<foreign>agama</foreign>). If they are not trusted* [servants], then we should not! If we insist on taking them, we should help them when they are sick, we should redeem them individually (? <foreign>sakadǝgdǝgna</foreign>) if they are dead or lost. All of that should be taken into account.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_06">
<p corresp="#skk_06.01">Further, as follows: if we are visited by the <foreign>same</foreign>*, <foreign>paṅuraṅ</foreign>, <foreign>dasa</foreign>, <foreign>calagara</foreign>, <foreign>upəti paṅgərəs rəma</foreign>*, our thoughts should be cheerful, we should feel as though being visited by family, relatives, younger and elder siblings, children, friends, children of younger siblings (<foreign>suvan</foreign>)*, children of elder siblings (<foreign>kaponakan</foreign>). That is the metaphor for it. But if we have things to share, [such as] food, drink, under garments, clothes [or] anything that we own*, we should feel as though making offerings and giving reception* to the ancestors and gods.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_06.02">Moreover, if we are employed [to go] to the dry rice field, to the paddy field, to the great paddy field (<foreign>seraṅ agəṅ</foreign>)*; fencing, digging a trench, putting animals into the pen, making snares, dam fishing*, fishing with a casting net, fishing with a line (?, ṅadodoger)*, fishing with drag-net (mapayaṅ), fishing with a sieve (<foreign>ñair</foreign>)*, ensnaring animals by two people (? <foreign>biñcaṅ</foreign>)* — any kind of employment for the master, we should not be displeased, we should not be temperamental*, we should not be angry* or fuss*. We should enjoy it all. We should  mean our tasks.</p>
</div>
<div corresp="#skk_07">
<p corresp="#skk_07.01">However, if we are returning home, we should not defecate on the edge of the road, by the side of the house, on its bright end, lest it be smelled by a nobleman [or] by a <foreign>gusti</foreign>, not to mention by people who do not pay attention*; lest [we] be cursed [and] blamed* by [our] mother, father [and] teachers, be opposed* by the elders, because of our reckless deeds. But if [we] obey the holy precepts, [we] defecate seven steps* from the road [and] urinate three steps from the road. May [we] not meet with criticism from other people, as we know <foreign>ulah pamali</foreign>*. The meaning is: <foreign>ulah</foreign> means sorrow, <foreign>pamali</foreign> means death.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_07.02">Furthermore, [we should] watch out for rope barriers (<foreign>gagavar</foreign>)*, the ends of snares (? <foreign>pucuk tambaluṅ</foreign>)*, as they could be court reservoirs*, forbidden enclosures, forbidden pavilions — all the more so for obstructing light*, for coming across [or] passing the king [when he is] walking about, because those are the places where offense is liable to happen.  If we enter the court, we must often look [in all directions], as it may be that we are trampling, bumping, hitting* [or] cutting a line.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_07.03">If we sit down, we should not face the wrong way; we should cross our legs politely. And if we are invited to speak by the master, we should think about what we will say. Whatever is appropriate will please the master. And we should pay close attention to the ones who are to be followed: officer, <foreign>gusti</foreign>, military officer (<foreign>kasasa</foreign>)*, member of the <foreign>bayangkara</foreign> corps, confidant (<foreign>nu marək</foreign>)*, messenger, painter, coppersmith, goldsmith, bracelet smith, blacksmith, make up expert (? <foreign>juru vidaṅ</foreign>)*, actor, puppeteer, trumpeter*, gamelan musician, mask performer (<foreign>tapukan</foreign>)*, joker, dry rice field farmer, palm tapper, paddy farmer, sweeper, death-defier (<foreign>belamati</foreign>), magician (? <foreign>juru moha</foreign>), <foreign>barat katiga</foreign>*, soldier, blowpiper, archer, warrior, collector of <foreign>dasa</foreign> and <foreign>calagara</foreign> (penalties), young shepherds, boar farmers, chicken farmers, fishermen*, divers*, [and] all those who are of use. If there are any ones who have the virtue of fidelity in service, it is they who are to be followed, for they dedicate themselves to the country.</p></div>
<div corresp="#skk_08">
<p corresp="#skk_08.01">If there is someone scolded by the master — such a one, his actions should not be followed, lest we also be scolded. This is an analogy for it: like a person going into the forest, who steps on a thorn, let’s step on it too*, it hurts in the same way. That is why, if there is someone who is praised as the agile, the nimble*, sensitive [and] generous (<foreign>paka pradana</foreign>)*, frugal (emet)*, conscientious, diligent, painstaking, faithful to the service of the master — follow the acts and the qualities of such a one, so that we too may be praised!</p>
<p corresp="#skk_08.02">If there is someone whose appearance is good, whose behavior is good [and] whose actions are good, we should follow as best as possible (<foreign>saagəṅna</foreign>)*, because he is considered a superior man.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_08.03">If there is someone whose appearance is beautiful [but] whose actions are bad [and] whose attitude is dumb, in that case (<foreign>itu</foreign>) we should not look at his appearance, we should not* follow his actions.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_08.04">If there is someone whose appearance is bad, whose attitude is dumb [but] whose actions are good, in that case we should not look at his attitude, we should not keep looking at his appearance, we should follow his actions.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_08.05">If there is someone whose appearance is bad, whose attitude is dumb, whose actions are bad, in that case [he] is what they call ‘the world’s offering (<foreign>caru</foreign>), the victim (<foreign>silih diri</foreign>) for the people of the whole world’*, the defect* of human beings.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_08.06">That is what should be remembered — the unmeritorious, the meritorious; the bad, the good* — take [them as] teacher. This is the reminder of it: if anyone dies while stealing, dies while sneaking, dies while robbing, dies while infiltrating, any kind of impudent [or] deceitful [behavior], we should watch them for [they] are not to be followed. That is called the vile as a teacher.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_08.07">There is more: if we see people performing wayang, listen to people performing pantun, acquire teachings from the stories, that is called the stage as teacher. If we acquire good teachings from people reading, that is called the story as teacher. If we observe the products of handicraft: carvings, sculptures, planks, drawings, we should not* ask the craftsmen* — we should find out by our own feelings, as a result of paying attention to other people’s skill. It is called profession* as a teacher.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_08.08">Acquiring precepts from children, it is called children as teachers. Acquiring <foreign>dharma</foreign> from our grandfather, it is called the grandfather as teacher. Acquiring rules of conduct from our elder brother (<foreign>lañcək</foreign>), it is called the elder brother (<foreign>kakaṅ</foreign>) as teacher. Acquiring rules of conduct from the elders, it is called our parents’ elder siblings (<foreign>uva</foreign>) as teachers. Acquiring rules of conduct from the places where we travel, (whether it is) in the village, in a place for staying overnight, in a place for breaking journey, in a place of lodging, it is called the road as teacher. Acquiring rules of conduct from our parents, it is called the origins as teacher. Especially if (you find rules of conduct in) words (<foreign>hatur</foreign>)* from a great scholar, it is called the excellence as teacher, it is called honor as teacher, it is called authority as teacher, it is called doctrines as teacher: those are called the four excellences (<foreign>catur-utama</foreign>). Which is why*, when they are finished being done by those who do, being accomplished by those who accomplish, (then) all are finished being observed: the bad and the good, the evil and the just.</p></div>
<div corresp="#skk_09">
<p corresp="#skk_09.01">Likewise, if there is someone who praises us, our feelings should not be joyful, [but] we should in turn cast back [the praise] to those who praise, so that we will not be overshadowed by the other’s praise. If we are keen on being praised, it is like the ‘long pole with weak extensions (<foreign>galah dava sinambuṅan tuna</foreign>)’. [If our] feelings are pleased with the praise, then it leads to vanity. Because we feel ourselves to be in our own house — by food, drink, pleasures, enjoyments, utensils (<foreign>pakaraṅ</foreign>)* — then they are used as something to be proud of (<foreign>aṅgəhan</foreign>). It is like the ‘long pole’ (as above); it is [also] like the ‘empty paddy stalk’*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_09.02">Likewise, if there is someone who insults us, we should accept all the other’s insults, which is why it is comparable to the ‘pole cut short’. Suppose we have warts, it is like water for bathing; suppose we have dry skin*, it is like a person coming to smearing [us] with oil; suppose we are hungry*, it is like a person coming to give rice*; suppose we are thirsty, it is like a person coming to give to drink; suppose we are dejected, it is like a person coming to give betel quid — they are called the five pure ones (<foreign>pañca-parisuda</foreign>). That is like the ‘pole cut short’.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_09.03">If [the insult] makes us happy, [we are] like paddy chock full [with rice grains]*, that might keep the people alive*, because the origin of joy and pleasure has been obtained. Even if those who are slandering us are wrong, [we should] take [their slander as] advice*. If we have the behavior (about which we are slandered), [we should] stop [it]. If we do not have [such] behavior, we should consider (<foreign>uṅaṅ</foreign>)* [the slander] (to merit attention), like mother, father [and] teachers. The meaning* of what is called a human being (<foreign>janma</foreign>): ‘It is considered the ultimate supreme; it is considered the deity becoming human; the one who has a perfect body*, who is the origin of goodness, and the source of the truth’.</p></div>
<div corresp="#skk_10">
<p corresp="#skk_10.01">These are the complementary practices*, so that no living beings* are ruined, so that [we are] blessed* in our houses: careful [and] conscientious, scrupulous [and] diligent, sensitive [and] generous*, not falling down (? mo rogol-rogol)*, champions among experts, strong [and] unfatigued*, mobile [and] nimble.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_10.02">If we put dry rice-fields (<foreign>gaga</foreign>) and paddy fields under cultivation, it is only so that we do not suffer. If we make an orchard, it is only so that we do not pick in someone else’s small field, in someone else’s broad field — except by virtue of our having asked permission, politely requesting*. [As for] domestic animals, we should not just buy, not just swap [them]. [As for] utensils, we should not just borrow [them]. [As for] blankets [and] loincloths, we should not have too many of them*. [As for] food and drink, we should not have too little. Our children and wife should be given advice, to avoid [their] being accused of being ‘disrespectful’ (<foreign>durbala siksa</foreign>)*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_10.03">Observe the hermits’ precepts for society: if we sleep, [it is only] as a remedy for sleepiness*; [if we] drink palm wine, [it is only] as a remedy for thirst; [if we] eat, [it is only] a remedy for hunger. We should not be careless [about them]. We should remember* their [potential] absence. Even more so by children and by wife, we should not be shackled, for they may not behave in accordance [with our advice]. If [they are] good, by virtue of us giving advice, after which [they] follow the advice, those are called our children and our wife. If they do not follow [our] admonition, they are the same as outsiders. But if we insist on claiming our wife and child despite them being away without giving any news*, we will probably be burdened, we will probably be lost in hell together, lost [will be] the results of our worship, ruined the results of the ancestors (<foreign>cakal bagal</foreign>)*.</p></div>
<div corresp="#skk_11">
<p corresp="#skk_11.01">This is the instruction of Darma Pitutur*, to avoid our not thinking of [the instruction of Darma Pitutur].</p>
<p rend="stanza" corresp="#skk_11.02">“<foreign>sriopeksah samutatah, paesanteh tan susuriyәm, jambaṅan esiniṅ bañu mahәniṅ, tah desanatah nora buksah</foreign>”*</p>
<p corresp="#skk_11.03">The meaning is: sri means gold. Gold is like this: If it is not coated, its beauty is washed away*. If it is coated, [it will be] beautifully bright* for it is well treated. Likewise is the analogy, for us humans here: if [we] follow the holy precepts, its essence will be well maintained by us, like the straight meeting its straight. Likewise, if we do not follow the holy precepts of the accomplished one (<foreign>krəta</foreign>)*, [it is] like the crooked meeting its crooked.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_11.04"><foreign>Paesan</foreign> means mirror. The mirror is like this: If it is not regarded attentively*, our image is vague. If it is regarded attentively, our appearance is clear upon that mirror. Likewise are we humans here. If we can follow the customs* of others adequately, it may well be internalized* by our feelings. If we cannot follow the advice, it is called stupid.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_11.05"><foreign>Jambaṅan</foreign> means an object giving reflection*. The mind of the one who is accomplished is like clear water. That is the reason why we should regard [it] attentively, then the heart will be pleased*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_11.06"><foreign>Desa</foreign> means settlement. If the settlement is empty, there is nothing to be followed. Words are like that: if they are not substantial, they are considered deceitful. But if the residence is filled, that is to be followed. Likewise are words: they should be meaningful, so that they be considered truthful in character*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_11.07">Likewise are we humans here. If we wish to know the source of the joy and happiness, we should remember the word of the Darma Pitutur. This is the verse:</p>
<p rend="stanza" corresp="#skk_11.08">‘The pond is the habitat of the goose; the forest is the elephant’s habitat; the sea is the habitat of fishes; flowers are the habitat of the bee’.</p>
