<p corresp="#skk_01.01">Here, as follows, is what will be taught by the holy man: the way (<foreign>de</foreign>) of one who searches weal.<note>The meaning of <foreign>de</foreign> is ambiguous. Another possibility is to take the third meaning recorded in OJED, viz. ‘in relation to, with regard to, toward, to’, in which case the alternative translation would be ‘what will be taught by the holy man to the one who searches weal’. See Oglobin 2000: 184.</note> As regards what are called the hermits’ holy precepts for society (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian</foreign>),<note> See the discussion of the title in the Chapter 6.</note> all people should exert themselves [to follow them]. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the hermits’ holy precepts for society.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-krəta</foreign>), which must be adhered to by all people. Anyone who starts to uphold the holy instructions of the accomplishments (<foreign>sasana krəta</foreign>), is destined to be long-lived, to be of long youth,<note>The word <foreign>ñovana</foreign>, which seems to be derived from Skt. <foreign>yauvana</foreign> ‘youth, youthfulness, adolescence, puberty, manhood’, here probably has one of the meanings ‘ageless, long youth, youthful’ (MW, s.v.) that are also inherent in the Skt. word.</note> to have success in paddy fields (<foreign>kuras</foreign>),<note>ASD translate <foreign>kuras</foreign> as ‘<foreign>ternak</foreign>’ (livestock), which seems unlikely. In MdS, <foreign>kuras</foreign> is a verbal base meaning ‘to rince, clean up’. One occurrence in KaPani 737 seems to furnish a clue: <foreign>upamana ṅuṅkuṅ añjiṅ, hayaṅ aya kadaekna, sandigana ṅuruṅ hayam, hayaṅ rampes pamuluna, upamana dina kəbo, hayaṅ nimu pakən ṅuras</foreign> “just as we raise dogs, wishing they are obedient; just as we cage the chickens, wishing their feathers are good; just as, regarding the buffalo, we wish to find them for <foreign>ṅuras</foreign>”. Seeing the relationship <foreign>ṅuras</foreign> with the buffalo, perhaps this word means ‘to plow’)? If so, then the base <foreign>kuras</foreign> most likely means ‘rice-field’.</note> to have success in cultivation,<note>The word <foreign>tahun</foreign> means ‘seasonal plant, i.e. agriculture’ = OJ (OJED: s.v. <foreign>tahun</foreign> 2). Cf. also RS 2.2 <foreign>ṅuniveh kahayvakənaniṅ rāt kabeh, dadyaniṅ tahun, laṇḍuṅaniṅ udan, karuhun kadīrghāyuṣakəna śrī mahārāja</foreign> “and especially he should foster the well-being of the whole world, the success of the crops, the long duration of rains, and in the first place bring about the longevity of the great king”. Among parallels in OS texts, I may cite PNJ 129 <foreign>jadyan kuras jadyan tahun</foreign> “The paddy fields and crops are successfully growing” and TB 35v <foreign>pada ñovana, dadian kuras, dadian tahun, dadian kaneneh</foreign> “All people are youthful, the paddy fields, crops, and livestocks are successfully growing”. Note that <foreign>dadian</foreign> and <foreign>jadyan</foreign> are equivalent, the former a loanword from OJ, the latter its proper OS form <foreign>jadyan</foreign> (from <foreign>jadi</foreign>).</note> to stand firm,<note>I interpret <foreign>dəgdəg tañjər</foreign> as ‘stand firm’. The word <foreign>dəgdǝg</foreign> is probably related to <foreign>adəg</foreign>, so in this case, <foreign>dǝgdəg tañjər</foreign> is a twin form (see Chapter 3, §Morphology). In some texts, we find <foreign>dǝdǝg</foreign> instead of <foreign>dǝgdǝg</foreign> (e.g. in PNJ 150 <foreign>dǝdǝg tañjǝr jaya ñovana</foreign>) so the word <foreign>dəgdǝg</foreign> seems to be a reduplication of <foreign>dǝg</foreign>. The word <foreign>dədǝg</foreign> in MdS means ‘well-built, strongly-built, square built, a fine body’, so it is synonymous with <foreign>tañjǝr</foreign> (MdS <foreign>tanjeur</foreign> ‘standing upright’). Cf.  <foreign>sakadəgdəgna</foreign> ‘according to the individual’ in SKK 5.3. However, it is noteworthy that Hardjadibrata (based on Eringa) notes the idiom <foreign>deugdeug tanjeuran</foreign> ‘where people come from all corners to see’. If this meaning was also prevalent in OS, then an alternative translation might be ‘crammed by visitors’.</note> to win in battle — all people [who do so] will be youthful.<note>The construction <foreign>ñovana na uraṅ reya</foreign> is rather unusual. Hardjadibrata designates this case in MdS as an unsyntactical compound. Maybe emend <foreign>ñovana na</foreign> to <foreign>ñovana</foreign>?</note></p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation<note>Based on OJED, <foreign>byakta</foreign> = <foreign>vyakti</foreign> (Skt visible appearance, becoming evident or known) evidence, proof, clarification, explanation; in later texts, esp. <foreign>kidung</foreign>s = <foreign>byakta</foreign>, q.v.</note> of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: [their are] the shadows of the ten holy virtues (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila</foreign>), the reflections of the ten holy paths (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga</foreign>), the manifestations of the ten sense faculties (<foreign>dasa-indriya</foreign>), what is needed to make<note> <foreign>di</foreign> here is marking the direct object, like <foreign>ri</foreign> in OJ. On the function of the preposition <foreign>di</foreign> in OS, see Chapter 3, §Note on <foreign>di</foreign>.</note> the distant world and the near world<note>In MdS, <foreign>lamba</foreign> means ‘singular, uncomplicated; simple, (just very) common’, like OJ <foreign>lamba</foreign> ‘single (not double), incomplete, halfhearted’. However, in the present context it seems that it is an OS translation of the OJ compound <foreign>bhuvana ləmbana</foreign>, attested in SHH 40.1 <foreign>manon vijñana ṅaranya panonta ri madoh ri bhuvana lǝmbana</foreign>, <foreign>jñānendriya ṅaranya panonta ri maparǝk maṅke pratyakṣa ṅaranya</foreign> “Seeing with discernment (<foreign>manon vijñāna</foreign>) is your means to see what is far in the ‘distant world’, the faculty of knowledge is your means to see what is near, here, which is called the direct perception”. The word <foreign>ləmbana</foreign> or <foreign>lamba</foreign> can be traced to Skt. <foreign>lamba</foreign> ‘hanging down’, but also ‘long, large, spacious’ (MW, s.v. <foreign>lamba</foreign>). Another way to analyze <foreign>bhuvana ləmbana</foreign> might be as deriving from <foreign>bhuv-anālambana</foreign>, which should be <foreign>bhv-anālambana</foreign> in correct Skt. (see OJED <foreign>anālambana</foreign>, meaning ‘without relation to an object’), perhaps a suitable way of saying 'distant'. What is clear is that <foreign>bumi lamba</foreign> must mean ‘distant world’, the opposite of <foreign>bumi parək</foreign>. I don’t understand what considerations led ASD to emend <foreign>bumi parək</foreign> to <foreign>bumi tan parək</foreign>. Cf. SC 536 <foreign>bumi lamba bumi parǝk</foreign>.</note> prosperous.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the wide world prosperous: having well-lit roads, plantations being large, well developed and productive (<foreign>paka pradana</foreign>),<note>The expression <foreign>paka pradana</foreign> is problematic both in terms of its meaning and of its function in the sentence. This combination occurs more than once in SKK (1.4, 8.1, 10.1) and once in <ref target="#smg_19.02">SMG 19.2</ref>. I have the impression that <foreign>paka</foreign> and <foreign>pradana</foreign> are two separate words, and that <foreign>paka</foreign> should not in this context be understood as a prefix. The word <foreign>paka</foreign>, without <foreign>pradana</foreign>, appears in AG 5r <foreign>si caṅciṅan</foreign>, <foreign>si laṅsitan, si paka, si rajǝn-lǝkǝn, si mva surahan, si preña</foreign>. The combination <foreign>paka pradana</foreign> only appears in lists of good characteristics applying to a servant or to a country. However, the meanings of both words are still unknown. Let us try to determine which meaning might be suitable to the context. As for <foreign>pradana</foreign>, the first derivation that comes to mind is from Skt. <foreign>pradhāna</foreign> ‘(Skt) chief thing or person, the most important or essential part; chiefly, in the first place’, in other words ‘virtuous’. The second, which I find more plausible, is from the Skt. <foreign>pradāna</foreign> ‘giving, presentation; gift’. As for <foreign>paka</foreign>, I suppose that it is to be explained as reflecting Skt. <foreign>pāka</foreign> ‘ripening, becoming ripe, ripeness; maturity, perfect development (e.g. <foreign>dhiyas</foreign>, of the intellect), development of consequences (as of an act done in a former life or of any act); completion, perfection’. In this case, the word <foreign>paka</foreign> could mean ‘mature’. We may then ask whether the word Mal. <foreign>peka</foreign> ‘caring, sensitive’ is also etymologically derived from Skt. <foreign>pāka</foreign>. The Sundanese and Malay words could alternatively be related to the Hindi word <foreign>pakkā</foreign> (which is traced back to Skt. pakva, another derivative of the root pac). The word <foreign>pakkā</foreign> has gone worldwide in the form of the English word <foreign>pukkah/pucka</foreign> (Hobson-Jobson 1903, s.v.). According to the Hindi dictionary by McGregor (1993), the meaning of <foreign>pakkā</foreign> is ‘1. cooked, boiled …; 2. transfer. ripe, mature, experienced, knowing, astute; …; 8. genuine, real, thoroughgoing, solid, reliable, fixed, standard; …’ and many other positive qualities. If OS paka and Mal. peka were derived from Skt. <foreign>pāka</foreign>, it would be surprising that no such word appears in OJ, and this may be a reason to prefer the derivation from a more recent layer of Indo-Aryan vocabulary such as Hindi <foreign>pakkā</foreign>. In sum, I interpret <foreign>paka pradana</foreign> rather loosely as meaning ‘well developed and productive’ if it is said of a country or ‘sensitive and generous’ in the case of human qualities. If we look at the paired series such as <foreign>emet</foreign> and <foreign>imət</foreign>, <foreign>rajən</foreign> and <foreign>lǝkən</foreign>, it appears that the meaning of <foreign>paka</foreign> may be almost synonymous with <foreign>pradana</foreign>, in other words, that <foreign>paka pradana</foreign> may be a ‘twin form’. On this concept of ‘twin form’, see Chapter 3.</note> having clean yards, having well-lit front yards,<note>In the Baduy dialect, <foreign>pipir</foreign> refers to parts of the open land on the back, left, and right of the house, while <foreign>buruan</foreign> refers only to the front side (Judistira K. Garna 1987: 77).</note> also having filled houses, filled rice barns, filled chicken coops, cultivated dry rice-fields, protected taps [of palm trees]. The result is a life full of vitality: having a long-lasting health, having youthful rulers (<foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign>).<note><foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign> literary means ‘one who carry the world’, i.e. ‘the ruler’. Cf. RY 24.124 <foreign>tūs ny ambək saṅ mavaṅ rat ya ta dumulurakən sattvāsiṅ atukar.</foreign></note> Even<note>In MdS, <foreign>saṅkilaṅ</foreign> is a conjunction meaning ‘(al)though, in spite of, notwithstanding; <foreign>sangkilangan</foreign> ‘although’, but in OS it also means ‘and yet, even’. Cf. RR 1696–1599 <foreign>saṅkilaṅ na tuaṅ ais, na pərəbu puspalava, eleh-alah tan pamənaṅ</foreign> ‘even your younger brother, Prince Puspa Lawa, has been utterly defeated’.</note> in the wide [world]: having grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes; having fresh green (<foreign>hejo lembok</foreign>) plants,<note> For a similar expression, see SKK 18.1.</note> having all trees bearing fruit, having fertile rains<note> Cf. OJ <foreign>laṇḍuh</foreign> ‘uninterrupted, prosperous’ (OJED, s.v.). ASD choose to emend it as <foreign>landuṅ</foreign>, which also means ‘long’ in MdS. </note>, having grown seasonal crops; [those] will bring life for people in general. That is what is called the holy instructions of the accomplished one (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ sasana krəta</foreign>) in the wide world.</p>

There is also a semantic connection with MdS <foreign>gulang-gapér</foreign>, <foreign>ngagulang-gapér </foreign>‘physically spoil so.

Probably <foreign>ñətñot</foreign> is an intervocalic reduplication with the same meaning. Another possibility is to relate <foreign>ñot</foreign> with MdS <foreign>ñuat</foreign> (from <foreign>suat</foreign>), meaning ‘pierce (so.’s heart as it were by telling evil things about him, remind him of an insult experienced etc.)’.</note> They should not, it is forbidden!<note> See the quasi-synonymous expression <foreign>ulah pamali</foreign> in SKK 4.8.</note> Its being forbidden leads to tears,<note> Among other reasons, my emendation <foreign>dadi luh</foreign> is based on the occurrence of the equivalent OJ expression <foreign>dadi luh</foreign> in three important <foreign>kakavin</foreign>s: HV 13.6 <foreign>ndatan panamban lara mankin śīrṇa rəmək hatinya dadi luh tan pantaran her-tali</foreign>; BY 9.14 <foreign>yāvətu sukha dadi luh ndān avas harṣa hetu</foreign>; BK 2.27 <foreign>vineh səpah təñuh tvas ira śīrṇa rakva dadi luh drava ri mata niran parambəhan panampəta niran taṅis mara-marah nrəpasuta riy asih nirāṅrəsəp</foreign>. Probably the change is from <foreign>jadi na əluh</foreign> &gt; <foreign>jadi nəluh</foreign>.</note> the heart wounded without being able to be cured, mantras being ineffective, intentions not becoming reality, because the holy hermits’ precepts for society are not adhered to.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_04.10">Likewise, if we are <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>, do not reprimand [us] discreetly. If we are reprimanded, [we] must not fail to be devoted to the <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>,<note> On the word <foreign>naṅganan</foreign>, see my commentary in SKK 2.1</note> because he is the agent (<foreign>tanda</foreign>) of His Majesty the king.<note> In Old Balinese Inscriptions such as Sembiran AI, we find that <foreign>taṇḍa haji</foreign> was translated as ‘<foreign>vorstelijk bewijs</foreign>’ (royal sign) by Goris (1954: 133). On the term <foreign>taṇḍa</foreign> in OJ, see Jákl 2019 who concluded that it is associated with the court milieu and typically figures in a military context. According to him, between the ninth and thirteenth centuries CE, <foreign>taṇḍa</foreign> were not ‘officers’, but rather active warriors in the service of the king or another lord, who stayed either at the court or were stationed in fortresses owned by the king or lesser lords in different parts of the realm. From the twelfth century CE onward, we encounter a category of royal notables denoted as <foreign>taṇḍa rakryān riṅ pakira-kiran</foreign>, rendered by Jákl as ‘lord’s men of [military] strategy’. These men formed the second highest echelon of state officials, preceded in rank only by the three highest dignitaries of the state. It seems that in the fourteenth century CE the importance of the category of <foreign>taṇḍa</foreign> diminished, though at least some of the men were still active combatants. We see that in 15th-century Sunda, based on SKK 11.20, <foreign>tanda</foreign> seems to have a function related to the law (<foreign>darma</foreign>) or litigation.</note></p>
