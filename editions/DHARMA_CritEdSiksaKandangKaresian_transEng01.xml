    <p n="1" corresp="#skk_01.01">Here, as follows, is what will be taught by the holy man: the way <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>de</foreign></supplied> of one who searches weal. As regards what are called the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu <supplied reason="explanation">saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian</supplied>, all people should exert themselves <supplied reason="subaudible">to follow them</supplied>. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu.</p>
     <p n="2" corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-krəta</foreign></supplied>, which must be adhered to by all people. Anyone who starts to uphold the holy instructions of the accomplishments <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>sasana krəta</foreign></supplied>, is destined to be long-lived, to be of long youth, to have success in paddy fields <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kuras</foreign></supplied>, to have success in cultivation, to stand firm, to win in battle — all people <supplied reason="subaudible">who do so</supplied> will be youthful.</p>
      <p n="3" corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: <supplied reason="subaudible">their are</supplied> the shadows of the ten holy virtues <supplied reason="explanation">saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila</supplied>, the reflections of the ten holy paths <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga</foreign></supplied>, the manifestations of the ten sense organs <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>dasa-indriya</foreign></supplied>, what is needed to make the mundane world and the present world prosperous.</p> 
      <p n="4" corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the mundane world prosperous: roads being well-lit, plantations being large, superior, <supplied reason="subaudible">but also</supplied> the side <supplied reason="subaudible">yard</supplied> being clean, the front yard being well-lit. Moreover, the house being full, the rice barn is full, the chicken coop being full, the dry rice-field being cultivated, the tap <supplied reason="subaudible">of palm trees</supplied> being protected. The result is a life full of vitality, a long-lasting health, youthfulness of the ruler <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign></supplied>. Even in the mundane <supplied reason="subaudible">world</supplied>, grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes — all grown with fresh green leaves <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>hejo lembok</foreign></supplied>, all trees bearing fruit, falling fertile rains, growing seasonal crops; <supplied reason="subaudible">those</supplied> will bring life for many people. That is what is called the holy instructions of accomplishment <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ sasana krəta</foreign></supplied> in the mundane world. </p>
       <p n="5" corresp="#skk_01.05">These are the ten accomplishments, considered as the shadow of the ten good conducts. It is the reflection of the ten paths, the manifestation of the ten organs.</p> 
       <p n="6" corresp="#skk_01.06">This is its explanation. Ears should not listen randomly <supplied reason="subaudible">to a discussion</supplied>, if it is not fit to be listened to. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>mala</foreign></supplied>, the payment <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>lunas</foreign></supplied> is punishment <supplied reason="subaudible">in</supplied> hell. But if they are used appropriately, then the result, <supplied reason="subaudible">obtained</supplied> from the ears, is considered optimal.</p> 
       <p n="7" corresp="#skk_01.07">Eyes should not watch randomly <supplied reason="subaudible">any event</supplied>, if it is not fit to be watched. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if they are used appropriately, then the result of watching is considered optimal.</p> 
    <p n="8" corresp="#skk_01.08">The skin should not be used jerkingly, due to hot and cold. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the skin is considered optimal.</p> 
      <p n="9" corresp="#skk_01.09">The tongue should not be wrong <supplied reason="subaudible">in</supplied> what is tasted. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the tongue is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="10" corresp="#skk_01.10">The nose should not smell wrongly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the nose is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="11" corresp="#skk_01.11">The mouth should not speak randomly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the mouth is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="12" corresp="#skk_01.12">The hands should not grasp randomly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But they are used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the hands is considered optimal.</p>
        <p n="13" corresp="#skk_01.13">The feet should not step randomly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if they are used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the feet is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="14" corresp="#skk_01.14">The anus should not be used rumblingly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the anus is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="15" corresp="#skk_01.15">The vulva and the penis should not be used for seducing, for <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the vulva and the penis is considered best. This is what is called the ten accomplishments.</p>
       <p n="16" corresp="#skk_01.16">If the ten gates are completely used appropriately, the behavior of all people will be good, let alone the behavior of His Majesty the king.</p>

    <p n="1" corresp="#skk_02.01">The following are called the ten devotions <supplied reason="explanation">dasa-prəbakti</supplied>: first, a child devoted to the father; 2, a wife devoted to <supplied reason="subaudible">her</supplied> husband; 3, a servant devoted to the officers <supplied reason="explanation">pacandaan</supplied>; 4, a pupil devoted to <supplied reason="subaudible">his</supplied> master; 5, a farmer devoted to the soldier; 6, a soldier devoted to the minister; 7, a minister is devoted to the one who naṅganan; 8, the one who naṅganan devoted to the governor; 9, the governor devoted to the king; 10, the king devoted to the gods; the gods devoted to the ancestors. They are called the ten devotions. 10.</p>
</div>
          
          <div>
             <p n="1" corresp="#skk_03.01">This is what should be practised, the message from the true sage. ‘Oṅ, <supplied reason="subaudible">I give</supplied> homage to Śiva! My veneration <supplied reason="subaudible">goes</supplied> to the Holy Five tathagatas!’ Pañca means five, tata means sound, gata means passion. Those are which will become a virtue, all of them. The five syllables <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pañcaksara</foreign></supplied> are the masters of men. The meaning is: the five syllables are manifest, being  seen, experienced, observed by the senses. The master is the one to be asked by the people. That is why they are called the masters of men. As for ignorance, <supplied reason="subaudible">it exists</supplied> since the world exists.</p>
              <p n="2" corresp="#skk_03.02">This is the “evidence” for it, that is the five spheres of activity <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pañca-byapara</foreign></supplied>: earth, water, fire, wind and ether. Words of the great holy man: “They are the substances of our <supplied reason="subaudible">bodies</supplied>; the skin is the earth, the blood <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> the saliva are the water, the eyes are the light, the bones are the wind, the head is the ether. It <supplied reason="explanation">the skin</supplied> is called the earth in the body. <supplied reason="explanation">While blood and saliva are called the water in the body, and so on.</supplied> The reason why they are compared to world leaders, is that they take shape as the king, the elder <supplied reason="explanation">rama</supplied>, the hermit, the ritual expert <supplied reason="explanation">disi</supplied>, and the sailor”.</p>
             <p n="3" corresp="#skk_03.03">These are the five sons (pañca-putra): saṅ Maṅukuhan is the earth, saṅ Katuṅ Maralah is the water, saṅ Karuṅ Kalah is the fire, saṅ Sandaṅ Grәba is the wind, saṅ Vrәti Kandayun is the ether.</p>
             <p n="4" corresp="#skk_03.04">These are the five kusikas: saṅ Kusika on the mountain, saṅ Garga in the swamp, saṅ Mestri on Mount Mahameru, saṅ Purusa in Mandiri, saṅ Patañjala in Pañjulan.</p>
              <p n="5" corresp="#skk_03.05">If the holy five sections (saṅ hyaṅ vuku lima) are taken into account altogether, the earth would be in harmony, all [its] quarters of space. All quarters of space are east (purba), south (daksina), west (pasirma), north (utara), center (madya).</p>
              <p n="6" corresp="#skk_03.06">Purba is the east, the abode of the god Iswara, whose color is white. Daksina is the south, the abode of the god Brahma, whose color is red. Pasirma is the west, the abode of the god Mahadéwa, whose color is yellow. Utara is the north, the abode of the god Wisnu, whose color is black. Madya is the center, the abode of the god Siwa, whose color is multifarious. [That is] the reason why the five sacred section (saṅ hyaṅ vuku lima) in the universe are like that.</p>
              <p n="7" corresp="#skk_03.07">These are the five sections in [the case of] the great scholar. The secret is experienced by the one who is conscious (si tutur); asceticism is experienced by the one who is pure (si liṅlaṅ); posture is experienced by the one who is firm (si pagəh); perception is experienced by the one who is capable (sy asəmbava); liberation is experienced by the one who shares without receiving a share, who limits without being limited. The five sections in [the case of] the great scholar are like that.</p>
              <p n="8" corresp="#skk_03.08">As follows are the causes of accomplishment: they are the five gods, all embodying your name, all watching your form. But if (the names and forms) are not guarded, as if crooked meets its crooked, straight meets its straight. This is how it is: it is by human actions that it becomes accomplished, by human actions that it becomes good.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
              <p n="1" corresp="#skk_04.01">These are the acts of the servant, every path taken by servants. The act means intellect [and] mode of conduct. Every path taken means: be fearful, be strength, be respectful, be honour, in behavior, in attitude, in action, in speech, especially when in front of His Majesty the king.</p>
              <p n="2" corresp="#skk_04.02">We should be faithful in service, in order to wipe out the ten defilements (dasa-kalesa), so that the impurity leading to sin will be annihilated, [and] heaven will be obtained.</p>
              <p n="3" corresp="#skk_04.03">If [you are] excessive in practising the acts of the servant, that is worse than a monkey (usyat) occupying a hill, performing penance on the top of the mountain, for it is forbidden to perform penance on an elephant mound [or] a lion mound, near a great danger.</p>
              <p n="4" corresp="#skk_04.04">These are the actions of man that will be of use to all people. Do not fail to follow the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu! If we wish to be free from the five forms of reincarnation (pañca-gati saṅsara), we should not be deceitful, should not have a habit of laziness, should not deceive ourselves. Deceiving ourselves means: what is present is considered absent, what is absent is considered present, what is true is considered not so, what is not so is considered true — so that his mind is scheming, pretending, deceiving, hurting. That is the explanation of being deceitful to ourselves.</p> 
             <p n="5" corresp="#skk_04.05">Being deceitful to other people means: plucking without asking permission, taking without asking, picking without requesting, let alone looting, thieving, plundering, robbing, everything that counts as impudent and deceitful. Those are called being deceitful to other people.</p>
             <p n="6" corresp="#skk_04.06">And also infiltrating, grabbing, pilfering, seizing, groping, sneaking, let alone hanging around with a host, with a dignitary, let alone with one's own master. That should even less be done, be practiced by the servants.</p>  
              <p n="7" corresp="#skk_04.07">Do not fail to practice polite, respectful, and refined words, to be humble and well-mannered to fellow humans, to family and relatives, let alone to our master. Use [your] feet to sit politely, [your] hands to pay respect.</p> 
              <p n="8" corresp="#skk_04.08">If we talk with a nobleman, with a gusti, with the lover of someone else, with a forbidden woman, let alone with our master; if we are employed [by them], [we] should not be angry in our minds, let alone answer wrongly, an expression of discontent visible to our master. Don’t! It is forbidden! The result of asceticism may fail! The result of the ancestors (? cakal bakal) [may] be lost! The results of hard work may be lost! [We will] be met by the god of worldly misfortune, fined by His Majesty the king.</p>
              <p n="9" corresp="#skk_04.09">If we are not faithful to our master, for instance if we are in a sick state, if we are tired, if we are careless, [then] let’s honestly acknowledge that we have been very disgraceful, so that we are acknowledged to be faithful in service. But if we act, we should not be weak, we should not fall short, should not refuse when being ordered, should not be envious [or] malicious with those engaged in the same service, especially when seeing someone who gets praise [or] gets an audience (parəkan); seeing someone who is favored by the master, then our thoughts may become overheated. They should not, it is forbidden! Its being forbidden leads to tears, the heart wounded without being able to be cured, mantras being ineffective, intentions not becoming reality, because the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu are not adhered to.</p>
              <p n="10" corresp="#skk_04.10">Likewise, if we are naṅganan, do not reprimand [us] discreetly. If we are reprimanded, [we] must not fail to be devoted to the naṅganan, because he is the agent (tanda) of His Majesty the king.</p>
              <p n="11" corresp="#skk_04.11">If we are under orders, [we] should not fail to maintain the Holy Precepts from the Hermitage Milieu, so that we are faithful to the commandments. But as regards the one who goes north, south, west, east, he must not si vok cante, must not si mur cante, shall not become si mar cante, shall not [become] darma cante. Those are called four considerations (catur-yatna).</p>
              <p n="12" corresp="#skk_04.12">This is the meaning. Si vok cante means easily tempted by food and drink. Si mur cante means guilty of participating in making those who steal, who confiscate, who deceive, spread in all directions; it is called the wrong destination. Si mar cante means to take merchandise, sheets of gold and silver, [even if] it is not ordered by the commander; it is called wrong purpose. Darma cante means tolerant of what is detestable to our master. He is ordered to fetch [someone], to go by foot [to pick up someone], and to kill those who are unfit for [our] master, [but] instead he becomes more careful, because they are friends, family, and relatives. That should not be done, for what is called the wrong binarih (?) is forbidden; it is called darma cante. Those things should not be practiced by the servants: to love the detestable, to detest the lovable. They are improper to be practiced by the servants.</p>
