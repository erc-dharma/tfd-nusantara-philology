As regards what are called the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu <supplied reason="explanation">saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian</supplied>, all people should exert themselves <supplied reason="subaudible">to follow them</supplied>. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu.</p>
     <p n="2" corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-krəta</foreign></supplied>, which must be adhered to by all people.

      <p n="3" corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: <supplied reason="subaudible">their are</supplied> the shadows of the ten holy virtues <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila</foreign></supplied>, the reflections of the ten holy paths <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga</foreign></supplied>, the manifestations of the ten sense organs <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>dasa-indriya</foreign></supplied>, what is needed to make the mundane world and the present world prosperous.</p> 
      <p n="4" corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the mundane world prosperous: roads being well-lit, plantations being large, superior, <supplied reason="subaudible">but also</supplied> the side <supplied reason="subaudible">yard</supplied> being clean, the front yard being well-lit. Moreover, the house being full, the rice barn is full, the chicken coop being full, the dry rice-field being cultivated, the tap <supplied reason="subaudible">of palm trees</supplied> being protected. The result is a life full of vitality, a long-lasting health, youthfulness of the ruler <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign></supplied>. Even in the mundane <supplied reason="subaudible">world</supplied>, grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes — all grown with fresh green leaves <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>hejo lembok</foreign></supplied>, all trees bearing fruit, falling fertile rains, growing seasonal crops; <supplied reason="subaudible">those</supplied> will bring life for many people.

       <p n="5" corresp="#skk_01.05">These are the ten accomplishments, considered as the shadow of the ten good conducts. It is the reflection of the ten paths, the manifestation of the ten organs.</p> 
       <p n="6" corresp="#skk_01.06">This is its explanation. Ears should not listen randomly <supplied reason="subaudible">to a discussion</supplied>, if it is not fit to be listened to. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>mala</foreign></supplied>, the payment <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>lunas</foreign></supplied> is punishment <supplied reason="subaudible">in</supplied> hell.

But they are used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the hands is considered optimal.</p>
        <p n="13" corresp="#skk_01.13">The feet should not step randomly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if they are used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the feet is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="14" corresp="#skk_01.14">The anus should not be used rumblingly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell.

             <p n="1" corresp="#skk_03.01">This is what should be practised, the message from the true sage. ‘Oṅ, <supplied reason="subaudible">I give</supplied> homage to Śiva! My veneration <supplied reason="subaudible">goes</supplied> to the Holy Five tathagatas!’ Pañca means five, tata means sound, gata means passion. Those are which will become a virtue, all of them. The five syllables <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pañcaksara</foreign></supplied> are the masters of men. The meaning is: the five syllables are manifest, being  seen, experienced, observed by the senses. The master is the one to be asked by the people. That is why they are called the masters of men. As for ignorance, <supplied reason="subaudible">it exists</supplied> since the world exists.</p>
              <p n="2" corresp="#skk_03.02">This is the “evidence” for it, that is the five spheres of activity <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pañca-byapara</foreign></supplied>: earth, water, fire, wind and ether. Words of the great holy man: “They are the substances of our <supplied reason="subaudible">bodies</supplied>; the skin is the earth, the blood <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> the saliva are the water, the eyes are the light, the bones are the wind, the head is the ether. It <supplied reason="explanation">the skin</supplied> is called the earth in the body. <supplied reason="explanation">While blood and saliva are called the water in the body, and so on.</supplied> The reason why they are compared to world leaders, is that they take shape as the king, the elder <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>rama</foreign></supplied>, the hermit, the ritual expert <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>disi</foreign></supplied>, and the sailor”.</p>
             <p n="3" corresp="#skk_03.03">These are the five sons <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pañca-putra</foreign></supplied>: saṅ Maṅukuhan is the earth, saṅ Katuṅ Maralah is the water, saṅ Karuṅ Kalah is the fire, saṅ Sandaṅ Grәba is the wind, saṅ Vrәti Kandayun is the ether.</p>
             <p n="4" corresp="#skk_03.04">These are the five kusikas: saṅ Kusika on the mountain, saṅ Garga in the swamp, saṅ Mestri on Mount Mahameru, saṅ Purusa in Mandiri, saṅ Patañjala in Pañjulan.</p>
              <p n="5" corresp="#skk_03.05">If the holy five sections <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ vuku lima</foreign></supplied> are taken into account altogether, the earth would be in harmony, all <supplied reason="subaudible">its</supplied> quarters of space. All quarters of space are east <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>purba</foreign></supplied>, south <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>daksina</foreign></supplied>, west <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pasirma</foreign></supplied>, north <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>utara</foreign></supplied>, center <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>madya</foreign></supplied>.</p>
              <p n="6" corresp="#skk_03.06">Purba is the east, the abode of the god Iswara, whose color is white. Daksina is the south, the abode of the god Brahma, whose color is red. Pasirma is the west, the abode of the god Mahadéwa, whose color is yellow. Utara is the north, the abode of the god Wisnu, whose color is black. Madya is the center, the abode of the god Siwa, whose color is multifarious. <supplied reason="subaudible">That is</supplied> the reason why the five sacred section <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ vuku lima</foreign></supplied> in the universe are like that.</p>
              <p n="7" corresp="#skk_03.07">These are the five sections in <supplied reason="subaudible">the case of</supplied> the great scholar. The secret is experienced by the one who is conscious <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>si tutur</foreign></supplied>; asceticism is experienced by the one who is pure <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>si liṅlaṅ</foreign></supplied>; posture is experienced by the one who is firm <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>si pagəh</foreign></supplied>; perception is experienced by the one who is capable <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>sy asəmbava</foreign></supplied>; liberation is experienced by the one who shares without receiving a share, who limits without being limited. The five sections in <supplied reason="subaudible">the case of</supplied> the great scholar are like that.</p>
              <p n="8" corresp="#skk_03.08">As follows are the causes of accomplishment: they are the five gods, all embodying your name, all watching your form. But if <supplied reason="explanation">the names and forms</supplied> are not guarded, as if crooked meets its crooked, straight meets its straight. This is how it is: it is by human actions that it becomes accomplished, by human actions that it becomes good.</p>

          <div>
              <p n="1" corresp="#skk_04.01">These are the acts of the servant, every path taken by servants. The act means intellect <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> mode of conduct. Every path taken means: be fearful, be strength, be respectful, be honour, in behavior, in attitude, in action, in speech, especially when in front of His Majesty the king.</p>
              <p n="2" corresp="#skk_04.02">We should be faithful in service, in order to wipe out the ten defilements <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>dasa-kalesa</foreign></supplied>, so that the impurity leading to sin will be annihilated, <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> heaven will be obtained.</p>
              <p n="3" corresp="#skk_04.03">If <supplied reason="subaudible">you are</supplied> excessive in practising the acts of the servant, that is worse than a monkey <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>usyat</foreign></supplied> occupying a hill, performing penance on the top of the mountain, for it is forbidden to perform penance on an elephant mound <supplied reason="subaudible">or</supplied> a lion mound, near a great danger.</p>
              <p n="4" corresp="#skk_04.04">These are the actions of man that will be of use to all people. Do not fail to follow the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu! If we wish to be free from the five forms of reincarnation <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pañca-gati saṅsara</foreign></supplied>, we should not be deceitful, should not have a habit of laziness, should not deceive ourselves. Deceiving ourselves means: what is present is considered absent, what is absent is considered present, what is true is considered not so, what is not so is considered true — so that his mind is scheming, pretending, deceiving, hurting. That is the explanation of being deceitful to ourselves.</p> 
             <p n="5" corresp="#skk_04.05">Being deceitful to other people means: plucking without asking permission, taking without asking, picking without requesting, let alone looting, thieving, plundering, robbing, everything that counts as impudent and deceitful. Those are called being deceitful to other people.</p>
             <p n="6" corresp="#skk_04.06">And also infiltrating, grabbing, pilfering, seizing, groping, sneaking, let alone hanging around with a host, with a dignitary, let alone with one's own master. That should even less be done, be practiced by the servants.</p>  
              <p n="7" corresp="#skk_04.07">We should not fail to practice polite, respectful, and refined words, to be humble and well-mannered to fellow humans, to family and relatives, let alone to our master. Use <supplied reason="subaudible">our</supplied> feet to sit politely, <supplied reason="subaudible">our</supplied> hands to pay respect.</p> 
              <p n="8" corresp="#skk_04.08">If we talk with a nobleman, with a gusti, with the lover of someone else, with a forbidden woman, let alone with our master; if we are employed <supplied reason="subaudible">by them</supplied>, <supplied reason="subaudible">we</supplied> should not be angry in our minds, let alone answer wrongly, an expression of discontent visible to our master. Don’t! It is forbidden! The result of asceticism may fail! The result of the ancestors <supplied reason="explanation">? <foreign>cakal bakal</foreign></supplied> <supplied reason="subaudible">may</supplied> be lost! The results of hard work may be lost! <supplied reason="subaudible">We will</supplied> be met by the god of worldly misfortune, fined by His Majesty the king.</p>
              <p n="9" corresp="#skk_04.09">If we are not faithful to our master, for instance if we are in a sick state, if we are tired, if we are careless, <supplied reason="subaudible">then</supplied> let’s honestly acknowledge that we have been very disgraceful, so that we are acknowledged to be faithful in service. But if we act, we should not be weak, we should not fall short, should not refuse when being ordered, should not be envious <supplied reason="subaudible">or</supplied> malicious with those engaged in the same service, especially when seeing someone who gets praise <supplied reason="subaudible">or</supplied> gets an audience <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>parəkan</foreign></supplied>; seeing someone who is favored by the master, then our thoughts may become overheated. They should not, it is forbidden! Its being forbidden leads to tears, the heart wounded without being able to be cured, mantras being ineffective, intentions not becoming reality, because the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu are not adhered to.</p>
              <p n="10" corresp="#skk_04.10">Likewise, if we are naṅganan, do not reprimand <supplied reason="subaudible">us</supplied> discreetly. If we are reprimanded, <supplied reason="subaudible">we</supplied> must not fail to be devoted to the naṅganan, because he is the agent <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>tanda</foreign></supplied> of His Majesty the king.</p>
              <p n="11" corresp="#skk_04.11">If we are under orders, <supplied reason="subaudible">we</supplied> should not fail to maintain the Holy Precepts from the Hermitage Milieu, so that we are faithful to the commandments. But as regards the one who goes north, south, west, east, he must not si vok cante, must not si mur cante, shall not become si mar cante, shall not <supplied reason="subaudible">become</supplied> darma cante. Those are called four considerations <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>catur-yatna</foreign></supplied>.</p>
              <p n="12" corresp="#skk_04.12">This is the meaning. Si vok cante means easily tempted by food and drink. Si mur cante means guilty of participating in making those who steal, who confiscate, who deceive, spread in all directions; it is called the wrong destination. Si mar cante means to take merchandise, sheets of gold and silver, <supplied reason="subaudible">even if</supplied> it is not ordered by the commander; it is called wrong purpose. Darma cante means tolerant of what is detestable to our master. He is ordered to fetch <supplied reason="subaudible">someone</supplied>, to go by foot <supplied reason="subaudible">to pick up someone</supplied>, and to kill those who are unfit for <supplied reason="subaudible">our</supplied> master, <supplied reason="subaudible">but</supplied> instead he becomes more careful, because they are friends, family, and relatives. That should not be done, for what is called the wrong binarih <supplied reason="explanation">?</supplied> is forbidden; it is called darma cante. Those things should not be practiced by the servants: to love the detestable, to detest the lovable. They are improper to be practiced by the servants.</p>    
              <p n="13" corresp="#skk_04.13">This is so that we obey the master, so that we are long taken as servants, so that we are always controlled by our master: follow the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu! pay attention to the dignitary! If the master scolds <supplied reason="subaudible">someone</supplied>, we too should participate in scolding with the master. If the master praises <supplied reason="subaudible">someone</supplied>, we too should participate in praising with the master. If we cannot participate in praising <supplied reason="subaudible">or</supplied> participate in being furious with the master, it is better that we keep quiet while devoting ourselves to the master.</p> 
              <p n="14" corresp="#skk_04.14">If we walk into the forest, <supplied reason="subaudible">we should wear</supplied> an upper garment, a lower garment, and a combination. When coming to the <supplied reason="subaudible">sea</supplied>side, <supplied reason="subaudible">we</supplied> wear upper and lower garments sakarajən.

              <p n="15" corresp="#skk_04.15">A rope on a forest garden, wood that has marked by a string, fruit that has been bunched together, firewood that stands ready, a covering for mushrooms, hives or nests of various bees <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>təvvan</foreign>, <foreign>odeṅ</foreign>, <foreign>ñəruan</foreign></supplied>, of wasps <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>eṅaṅ</foreign></supplied>, of woodworm <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>ulam</foreign></supplied>, a fishing dam <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>parakan</foreign></supplied> — all kinds of ownership marks <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>babayan</foreign></supplied>: we should not take them carelessly, let alone bring down other people’s taps. That should not be done, for it is the origin of guilt, the source of suffering and misery.</p>
              <p n="16" corresp="#skk_04.16">If we find a road, large or small, <supplied reason="subaudible">we should</supplied> quickly wear loin-cloth or a combination, <supplied reason="subaudible">as</supplied> we might be faced with gustis or with mantris. <supplied reason="subaudible">We</supplied> should not fail to move to the left and bend down.

              <p n="1" corresp="#skk_05.01">Keep in mind the Precepts from the Hermitage Milieu, and beware of adultery. Do not go and whimper about the forbidden women of others, widowed maidens, for [you] might be guilty of ‘adultery of the road’; especially [do not go and] hold hands, sharing a seat on a tree trunk, on a couch, in a shelter (təpas), one with another. [It] is called ‘adultery of the seating place’. Standing face to face by the side of the house, in the yard, one with another. It is called ‘adultery of the yard’. Answering someone who coughs, who is clearing the throat, who is expectorating, especially someone else’s mother’s song. It is called ‘the roaring cow’ (ləmbu aṅgala). Resting on the place where the other one has sat — on a post, on a tree, on a stone — [after] seeing her having gotten up then replacing them to lean, that is called ‘the rubbing cow’ (ləmbu aṅgasir). Those should be remembered, if we want to free ourselves from hell.</p>
              <p n="2" corresp="#skk_05.02">And also joining together in one lodging, one residence, one shelter, one couch, with other women (?), with forbidden women of someone else; it is called ‘the buffalo in one pen’ (kəbo sapitunahan). Those are the things to be kept in mind. They are called forbidden acts.</p>
              <p n="3" corresp="#skk_05.03">In the same way, if we are going on a journey, we shouldn’t [do that], shouldn’t desire to be followed by the servants of someone else. If we desire to take them, we should ask their master. If they are trusted [servants], [we should] make an oath (as to our liability) for their sickness, for their death, for their loss, [for their] passing  away and dying, in any way whatsoever. If that [be the case], we should take [them]. There is no one who may be blamed, for an oath is more eminent than [written] law (agama). If they are not trusted [servants], then we should not! If we insist on taking them, we should help them when they are sick, we should redeem them individually (? sakadǝgdǝgna) if they are dead or lost. All of that should be taken into account.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
              <p n="1" corresp="#skk_06.01">Further, as follows: if we are visited by the same, paṅuraṅ, dasa, calagara, upəti paṅgərəs rəma, our thoughts should be cheerful, we should feel as though being visited by family, relatives, younger and elder siblings, children, friends, children of younger siblings (suvan), children of elder siblings (kaponakan). That is the metaphor for it. But if we have things to share, [such as] food, drink, blankets, clothes [or] anything that we own, we should feel as though making offerings and giving reception to the ancestors and gods.</p>
              <p n="2" corresp="#skk_06.02">Moreover, if we are employed [to go] to the dry rice field, to the paddy field, to the great paddy field (seraṅ agəṅ); fencing, digging a trench, putting animals into the pen, making snares, dam fishing, fishing with a casting net, fishing with a line (?, ṅadodoger), fishing with drag-net (mapayaṅ), fishing with a sieve (ñair), ensnaring animals by two people (? biñcaṅ) — any kind of employment for the master, we should not be displeased, we should not be temperamental, we should not be angry or fuss. We should enjoy it all. We should  mean our tasks.</p>

          <div>
              <p n="1" corresp="#skk_07.01">However, if we are returning home, we should not defecate on the edge of the road, by the side of the house, on its bright end, as it may be smelled by a nobleman [or] by a gusti, not to mention by people who do not pay attention; as it may be that [we] are cursed [and] assailed by [our] mother, father [and] teachers, be opposed by the elders, because of our reckless deeds. But if [we] obey the holy precepts, [we] defecate seven steps from the road [and] urinate three steps from the road. May [we] not meet with criticism from other people, as we know ulah pamali. The meaning is: ulah means sorrow, pamali means death.</p>
              <p n="2" corresp="#skk_07.02">Furthermore, [we should] watch out for rope barriers (gagavar), the ends of snares (? pucuk tambaluṅ), or possibly court reservoirs, forbidden pens, forbidden pavilions — all the more so for obstructing light, for coming across [or] passing the king [when he is] walking about, because those are the places where offense is liable to happen.  If we enter the court, we must often look [in all directions], as it may be that we are trampling, bumping, hitting [or] cutting a line.</p>
