<p corresp="#skk_01.01">Here, as follows, is what will be taught by the holy man: the way (de) of one who searches weal.<note>The meaning of <foreign>de</foreign> is ambiguous. Another possibility is to take the third meaning recorded in OJED, viz. ‘in relation to, with regard to, toward, to’, in which case the alternative translation would be ‘what will be taught by the holy man to the one who searches weal’. See Oglobin 2000: 184.</note> As regards what are called the hermits’ holy precepts for society (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian</foreign>),<note> See the discussion of the title in the Chapter 6, §The Title.</note> all people should exert themselves <supplied reason="subaudible">to follow them</supplied>. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the hermits’ holy precepts for society.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-krəta</foreign>), which must be adhered to by all people. Anyone who starts to uphold the holy instructions of the accomplishments (<foreign>sasana krəta</foreign>), is destined to be long-lived, to be of long youth,<note> The word <foreign>ñovana</foreign>, which seems to be derived from Skt. <foreign>yauvana</foreign> ‘youth, youthfulness, adolescence, puberty, manhood’, here probably has one of the meanings ‘ageless, long youth, youthful’ (MW, s.v.) that are also inherent in the Skt. word.</note> to have success in paddy fields (<foreign>kuras</foreign>),<note> ASD translate <foreign>kuras</foreign> as ‘<foreign>ternak</foreign>’ (livestock), which seems unlikely. In MdS, <foreign>kuras</foreign> is a verbal base meaning ‘to rince, clean up’. One occurrence in KaPani 737 seems to furnish a clue: <foreign>upamana ṅuṅkuṅ añjiṅ, hayaṅ aya kadaekna, sandigana ṅuruṅ hayam, hayaṅ rampes pamuluna, upamana dina kəbo, hayaṅ nimu pakən ṅuras </foreign>“just as we raise dogs, wishing they are obedient; just as we cage the chickens, wishing their feathers are good; just as, regarding the buffalo, we wish to find them for <foreign>ṅuras</foreign>”. Seeing the relationship <foreign>ṅuras</foreign> with the buffalo, perhaps this word means ‘to plow’)? If so, then the base <foreign>kuras </foreign>most likely means ‘rice-field’.</note> to have success in cultivation,<note> The word <foreign>tahun</foreign> means ‘seasonal plant, i.e. agriculture’ = OJ (OJED: s.v. <foreign>tahun</foreign> 2). Cf. also RS 2.2 <foreign>ṅuniveh kahayvakənaniṅ rāt kabeh, dadyaniṅ tahun, laṇḍuṅaniṅ udan, karuhun kadīrghāyuṣakəna śrī mahārāja </foreign>“and especially he should foster the well-being of the whole world, the success of the crops, the long duration of rains, and in the first place bring about the longevity of the great king”<foreign>.</foreign> Among parallels in OS texts, I may cite PNJ 129 <foreign>jadyan kuras jadyan tahun </foreign>“The paddy fields and crops are successfully growing” and TB 35v  <foreign>pada ñovana, dadian kuras, dadian tahun, dadian kaneneh </foreign>“All people are youthful, the paddy fields, crops, and livestocks are successfully growing”. Note that <foreign>dadian</foreign> and <foreign>jadyan</foreign> are equivalent, the former a loanword from OJ, the latter its proper OS form <foreign>jadyan</foreign> (&lt; <foreign>jadi</foreign>).</note> to stand firm,<note>I interpret <foreign>dəgdəg tañjər</foreign> as ‘stand firm’. The word <foreign>dəgdǝg</foreign> is probably related to <foreign>adəg</foreign>, so in this case, <foreign>dǝgdəg tañjər</foreign> is a twin form (see Chapter 3, §Morphology). In some texts, we find <foreign>dǝdǝg</foreign> instead of <foreign>dǝgdǝg</foreign> (e.g. in PNJ 150 <foreign>dǝdǝg tañjǝr jaya ñovana</foreign>) so the word <foreign>dəgdǝg</foreign> seems to be a reduplication of <foreign>dǝg</foreign>. The word <foreign>dədǝg</foreign> in MdS means ‘well-built, strongly-built, square built, a fine body’, so it is synonymous with tañjǝr (MdS tanjeur ‘standing upright’). Cf. <foreign>sakadəgdəgna</foreign> ‘according to the individual’ in SKK 5.3. However, it is noteworthy that Hardjadibrata (based on Eringa) notes the idiom <foreign>deugdeug tanjeuran</foreign> ‘where people come from all corners to see’. If this meaning was also prevalent in OS, then an alternative translation might be ‘crammed by visitors’.</note> to win in battle — all people <supplied reason="subaudible">who do so</supplied> will be youthful.<note> The construction <foreign>ñovana na uraṅ reya</foreign> is rather unusual. Hardjadibrata designates this case in MdS as an unsyntactical compound. Maybe emend <foreign>ñovana na</foreign> &gt; <foreign>ñovana</foreign>? </note></p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation<note> Based on OJED, <foreign>byakta</foreign> = <foreign>vyakti</foreign> (Skt visible appearance, becoming evident or known) evidence, proof, clarification, explanation; in later texts, esp. <foreign>kidung</foreign>s = <foreign>byakta</foreign>, q.v.</note> of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: <supplied reason="subaudible">their are</supplied> the shadows of the ten holy virtues (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila</foreign>), the reflections of the ten holy paths (<foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga</foreign>), the manifestations of the ten sense faculties (<foreign>dasa-indriya</foreign>), what is needed to make<note> <foreign>di</foreign> here is marking the direct object, like <foreign>ri</foreign> in OJ. On the function of the preposition <foreign>di</foreign>in OS, see Chapter 3, §Note on <foreign>di</foreign>.</note> the distant world and the near world<note> In MdS, <foreign>lamba</foreign> means ‘singular, uncomplicated; simple, (just very) common’, like OJ <foreign>lamba</foreign> ‘single (not double), incomplete, halfhearted’. However, in the present context it seems that it is an OS translation of the OJ compound <foreign>bhuvana ləmbana</foreign>, attested in SHH 40.1: <foreign>manon vijñana ṅaranya panonta ri madoh ri bhuvana lǝmbana</foreign>, <foreign>jñānendriya ṅaranya panonta ri maparǝk maṅke pratyakṣa ṅaranya</foreign> “Seeing with discernment (<foreign>manon vijñāna</foreign>) is your means to see what is far in the ‘distant world’, the faculty of knowledge is your means to see what is near, here, which is called the direct perception”. The word <foreign>ləmbana</foreign> or <foreign>lamba</foreign> can be traced to Skt. <foreign>lamba</foreign> ‘hanging down’, but also ‘long, large, spacious’ (MW, s.v. <foreign>lamba</foreign>). Another way to analyze bhuvana ləmbana might be as deriving from bhuv-anālambana, which should be <foreign>bhv-anālambana</foreign> in correct Skt. (see OJED <foreign>anālambana</foreign>, meaning ‘without relation to an object’), perhaps a suitable way of saying 'distant'. What is clear is that <foreign>bumi lamba</foreign> must mean ‘distant world’, the opposite of <foreign>bumi parək</foreign>. I don’t understand what considerations led ASD to emend <foreign>bumi parək</foreign> to <foreign>bumi tan parək</foreign>. Cf. SC 536 <foreign>bumi lamba bumi parǝk</foreign>.</note> prosperous.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the wide world prosperous: having well-lit roads, plantations being large, well developed and productive (<foreign>paka pradana</foreign>),<note>The expression <foreign>paka pradana</foreign> is problematic both in terms of its meaning and of its function in the sentence. This combination occurs more than once in SKK (1.4, 8.1, 10.1) and once in <ref target="#smg_19.02">SMG 19.2</ref>. I have the impression that paka and pradana are two separate words, and that paka should not in this context be understood as a prefix. The word paka, without pradana, appears in AG 5r <foreign>si caṅciṅan</foreign>, <foreign>si laṅsitan</foreign>, <foreign>si paka, si rajǝn-lǝkǝn, si mva surahan</foreign>, <foreign>si preña</foreign>. The combination <foreign>paka pradana</foreign> only appears in lists of good characteristics applying to a servant or to a country. However, the meanings of both words are still unknown. Let us try to determine which meaning might be suitable to the context. As for <foreign>pradana</foreign>, the first derivation that comes to mind is from Skt. <foreign>pradhāna</foreign> ‘(Skt) chief thing or person, the most important or essential part; chiefly, in the first place’, in other words ‘virtuous’. The second, which I find more plausible, is from the Skt. <foreign>pradāna</foreign> ‘giving, presentation; gift’. As for paka, I suppose that it is to be explained as reflecting Skt. <foreign>pāka</foreign> ‘ripening, becoming ripe, ripeness; maturity, perfect development (e.g. dhiyas, of the intellect), development of consequences (as of an act done in a former life or of any act); completion, perfection’. In this case, the word <foreign>paka</foreign> could mean ‘mature’. We may then ask whether the word Mal. <foreign>peka</foreign> ‘caring, sensitive’ is also etymologically derived from Skt. <foreign>pāka</foreign>. The Sundanese and Malay words could alternatively be related to the Hindi word <foreign>pakkā</foreign> (which is traced back to Skt. pakva, another derivative of the root pac). The word <foreign>pakkā</foreign> has gone worldwide in the form of the English word <foreign>pukkah/pucka</foreign> (Hobson-Jobson 1903, s.v.). According to the Hindi dictionary by McGregor (1993), the meaning of <foreign>pakkā</foreign> is ‘1. cooked, boiled …; 2. transfer. ripe, mature, experienced, knowing, astute; …; 8. genuine, real, thoroughgoing, solid, reliable, fixed, standard; …’ and many other positive qualities. If OS <foreign>paka</foreign> and Mal. peka were derived from Skt. pāka, it would be surprising that no such word appears in OJ, and this may be a reason to prefer the derivation from a more recent layer of Indo-Aryan vocabulary such as Hindi <foreign>pakkā</foreign>. In sum, I interpret paka pradana rather loosely as meaning ‘well developed and productive’ if it is said of a country or ‘sensitive and generous’ in the case of human qualities. If we look at the paired series such as emet and imət, rajən and lǝkən, it appears that the meaning of <foreign>paka</foreign> may be almost synonymous with pradana, in other words, that <foreign>paka pradana</foreign> may be a ‘twin form’. On this concept of ‘twin form’, see Chapter 3.</note> having clean yards, having well-lit front yards,<note>In the Baduy dialect, <foreign>pipir</foreign> refers to parts of the open land on the back, left, and right of the house, while <foreign>buruan</foreign> refers only to the front side (Judistira K. Garna 1987: 77).</note> also having filled houses, filled rice barns, filled chicken coops, cultivated dry rice-fields, protected taps <supplied reason="subaudible">of palm trees</supplied>. The result is a life full of vitality: having a long-lasting health, having youthful rulers (<foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign>).<note><foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign> literary means ‘one who carry the world’, i.e. ‘the ruler’. Cf. RY 24.124 <foreign>tūs ny ambək saṅ mavaṅ rat ya ta dumulurakən sattvāsiṅ atukar.</foreign></note> Even<note> In MdS, <foreign>saṅkilaṅ</foreign> is a conjunction meaning ‘(al)though, in spite of, notwithstanding; <foreign>sangkilangan</foreign> ‘although’, but in OS it also means ‘and yet, even’. Cf. RR 1696–1599 <foreign>saṅkilaṅ na tuaṅ ais, na pərəbu puspalava, eleh-alah tan pamənaṅ</foreign> “even your younger brother, Prince Puspa Lawa, has been utterly defeated“.</note> in the wide <supplied reason="subaudible">world</supplied>: having grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes; having fresh green (<foreign>hejo lembok</foreign>) plants,<note>For a similar expression, see SKK 18.1.</note> having all trees bearing fruit, having fertile rains,<note> Cf.

My veneration <supplied reason="subaudible">goes</supplied> to the Holy Five <foreign>tathagatas</foreign>!’ <foreign>Pañca</foreign> means five, <foreign>tata</foreign> means speech, <foreign>gata</foreign> means passion.<note>The relation between <foreign>gata</foreign> and <foreign>raga</foreign> ‘body’ is obscure. We could interpret <foreign>gata</foreign> as ‘those that are left’, and <foreign>raga</foreign> as ‘passion’. In this case, the translation would be “those that are left are passions”. But it seems more persuasive to take <foreign>gata</foreign> as intended to stand for Skt./OJ <foreign>gātra</foreign> ‘body’ (MW, s.v.; OJED, s.v.). The word <foreign>gātra</foreign> is attested in Kuñj 28: <foreign>ikaṅ cetana, ya ta ikaṅ gave tr̥ṣṇa, ya ta misanakən ikaṅ ātma pat, ya ta dadi kinimpəlakən, ya matəmahan ri śarīra gātra</foreign> “The consciousness, it is the product of craving, it has as relatives the four souls, it becomes a solid object, it becomes the body and the limbs”. It is important to note that the one of the mss. of the <foreign>Kuñjarakarṇa</foreign> comes from West Java.</note> Those ones should be well maintained, all of them. The five syllables (<foreign>pañcaksara</foreign>) are the masters of men. The meaning is: the five syllables are manifest, being  seen, experienced,<note>The word <foreign>kavrətan</foreign> is derived from <foreign>vrətta</foreign> Skt. ‘Set in motion; occurred, happened; past; matter, affair; action, conduct’. However, the manuscript has <foreign>-on</foreign> instead of <foreign>-an</foreign>, probably intended to make a correspondent sound with <foreign>katoṅton</foreign>. Cf. JM 18.22 <foreign>diucap tan kaucap, tan katoṅton, tan kavrətan, tan karagap, tan kasikəp, tan kagaməl, tan karasa</foreign> “it is said without being spoken, not being seen, not being experienced, not being touched, not being catched, not being grasped”.</note> observed, <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> perceived by the senses. The master is the one to be asked by the people. That is why they are called the masters of men. As for ignorance,<note>I take <foreign>saṅmoha</foreign> as a Sanskrit derivative <foreign>sammoha</foreign> ‘stupefaction, bewilderment, confusion, insensibility, unconsciousness, ignorance, folly, illusion of mind’, not as a person <foreign>saṅ moha</foreign> ‘the one who is ignorant’. Cf. OJ <foreign>samoha</foreign> ‘id’. Could it be that the phenomenon of <foreign>ṅ</foreign> instead of <foreign>m</foreign> originates from the manner of interpreting <foreign>panyecek</foreign>? Cf. <foreign>oṅ</foreign> above, and <foreign>biṅba</foreign> (understood as <foreign>bimba</foreign>) in the inscription Kawali 5 (Aditia Gunawan &amp; Griffiths 2021: 187). The sounds /m/ and /ṅ/ are sometimes found to be interchangeable in MdS, for instance <foreign>bingbang</foreign> and <foreign>bimbang</foreign> ‘be in doubt’.

Cf. OJ <foreign>utpatti, utpətti, utpati, utpəti, upəti</foreign> ‘coming into existence; origin, birth, incarnation’. Also in OS texts, <foreign>upati</foreign> figures in meanings such as ‘manifestation, appearance’. Cf.

I tend to associate <foreign>panti</foreign> with Skt. <foreign>paṅkti</foreign> ‘row, set, series, group, troop, company’ (MW, s.v.). If so, we are dealing with the local form of the Sanskrit compound <foreign>vinayapaṅkti</foreign>, which would mean ‘set of rules, series of training’.

<p corresp="#skk_12.06">That is how we are, as humans, continually* descending from the unmanifest, <supplied reason="subaudible">but</supplied> not finding the manners of the Gods, rushing to be incarnated as humans, because their appearance is silly, their behavior is ignorant, <supplied reason="subaudible">and they are</supplied> incapable of following the acts of the ones who know.

<p corresp="#skk_13.01">These are the symbolic terms (<foreign>siloka</foreign>)* for the behavior of wrong people: lawless (<foreign>buraṅkak</foreign>)*, anxious (? <foreign>marende</foreign>)*, sulky (<foreign>mariris</foreign>)*, shameful (<foreign>viraṅ</foreign>). They are called the four demons. The meaning is: <foreign>buraṅkak</foreign> means shuddering. What is horrifying*, as it were, is the behavior of the person who is envious, surly, staring, coarse (?, <foreign>gasoṅ</foreign>)*, rude in speech, ugly in behavior, hot of heart. <supplied reason="subaudible">Such behavior</supplied> is considered improper. That is what the behavior of such men is like, horrifying as it were. He becomes a demon, Durga, Durgi, the demon Kala. His place is in the dirt of the earth.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.02">The dirty soils are: hollows, clusters (? <foreign>saroṅge</foreign>)*, lime-stone cliffs (<foreign>cadas gantuṅ</foreign>), scattered stones*, gorges, swamps*, rhinoceros ponds, tree trunks upside down* and aslant (<foreign>cataṅ nuṅgaṅ cataṅ noṅgeṅ</foreign>), mine tunnels (<foreign>garuṅguṅan gareṅgeṅan</foreign>)*, dangerous lands (<foreign>saṅhar</foreign>)*, burning grounds*, <supplied reason="subaudible">lands of</supplied> crawling animals (<foreign>varian</foreign>), hillocks, male soils (<foreign>ləmah laki</foreign>), pigsties, gutters (<foreign>kalomberan</foreign>)*, rubbish dumps, cremation grounds (<foreign>səma</foreign>)* — every kind of soil avoided.</p>

That is why they become horrifying. That is the meaning of <foreign>buraṅkak</foreign>.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.04"><foreign>Marende</foreign> means: being cooled down* and yet feeling hot; being given pity*, being given sympathy, being taken care of, being coddled, being given pleasures <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> enjoyments*, servants <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> slaves, and yet mistrusting <supplied reason="subaudible">them</supplied>.

One hundred thousand evil men are suffering there together. In the west are the Fire-Headed ghosts*. Humans cannot fathom how much suffering is there. In the north, there are one hundred people suffering together there, like grass-hoppers on a skewer. In the middle is the crow of the Patana*, with the Dog ghosts. Thousands of evil people are suffering there. That is the misery of those called <foreign>marende</foreign>.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.05"><foreign>Mariris</foreign> means defiled, disgusting like excrement, defiled like a reeking carcass. Such is the conduct of people who are kleptomaniac, who seize indiscriminately, or even take indiscriminately, without asking, stealing, plundering, deceiving, pilfering — all kinds of lying* to good persons. When he dies, his soul* will suffer, for one thousand <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> one hundred years afflicted by the curse of the gods. That is why birth as a human is not in sight. As for what he becomes: <foreign>koter</foreign>*, <foreign>jaṅgel</foreign>*, crop-worm*, horse-fly*, <foreign>titiṅgi</foreign>*, <foreign>jambəloṅ</foreign>*, leatherleaf slug*, <foreign>mear</foreign>*, <foreign>pacet</foreign>* (blood sucking haemadipsa), leech, <foreign>ləhəṅ</foreign>, <foreign>gərəṅ</foreign>* — everything that is despised by people in general, that is what is called <foreign>mariris</foreign>.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_13.06">Disgrace (<foreign>viraṅ</foreign>) means unwilling to be sincere, unwilling to truthful, unwilling to be proper, unwilling to be frank, unwilling to be polite.

They are called the three forms of consciousness.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_14.02">Consciousness is <supplied reason="subaudible">a person endowed with it</supplied> being able to taste, to drink, <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> being able to have pleasure; that is called consciousness.

His exclamations* are: are ‘be well!’ (<foreign>sumaṅər</foreign>), ‘what a pity!’ (<foreign>tətəiṅ amat</foreign>). As numerous are the ten pacifying acts*, namely: being virtuous*, reverent (<foreign>nama</foreign>)*, sympathetic*, forgiving*, loving, compassionate, generous*, gentle*, tranquil, ingratiating. That is why someone who is given an order is happy <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> joyful, bright <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> shining. That is called the ultimate consciousness.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_14.04">These are the metaphors for it*: gold, silver, jewel, diamond. They are called the four holy courtesies. This is its meaning: gold means the speech which is right, accurate, clear, <supplied reason="subaudible">applying</supplied> the formula of five syllables*. Silver means the mind which is accomplished, proper, good. Jewel means his consciousness is bright <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> shining, wide <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> broad*. Diamond means cheerfully laughing*, visibly smiling*, pleasant of heart. They are called the four courtesies.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_14.05">They are the people who originate from the pure ones among lands.

They are called the four accomplished ones. That is why in the present, men who are aware of the holy supreme <foreign>dharma</foreign>, knowledgeable about the secret teachings of men, they are called esoteric men*.</p>

Likewise are the people: the cause of their being treated well is that good behavior of theirs. That is why people are bad by their behavior, why they are good by their behavior*.</p>
<p corresp="#skk_16.02">Water is like that, insofar as the choices of it are said to be two. Water that is refreshing and clear is the holy supreme <foreign>dharma</foreign>, that is what is practiced by the great scholars. Water that is haunted and turbid is the emotional conduct (<foreign>rasa-carita</foreign>), which is practiced by all the <foreign>viku</foreign>s for whom the <foreign>nec plus ultra</foreign> is worldly*. That is why it (i.e., water) is comparable to consciousness* as well as unconsciousness. Consciousness is aware and mindful of memories without turning into forgetfulness. It is the root of a favorable rebirth, the cause of a prosperous earth*. Unconsciousness is forgetfulness <supplied reason="subaudible">and</supplied> confusion, not endowed with memory. It is the cause of destruction, the starting point of the Kali era, the base of deviation, the root of falsehood*. It is the cause of people going to hell.
