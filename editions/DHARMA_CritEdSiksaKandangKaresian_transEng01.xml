As regards what are called the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu <supplied reason="explanation">saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian</supplied>, all people should exert themselves <supplied reason="subaudible">to follow them</supplied>. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu.</p>
     <p n="2" corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-krəta</foreign></supplied>, which must be adhered to by all people. Anyone who starts to uphold the holy instructions of the accomplishments <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>sasana krəta</foreign></supplied>, is destined to be long-lived, to be of long youth, to have success in paddy fields <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kuras</foreign></supplied>, to have success in cultivation, to stand firm, to win in battle — all people <supplied reason="subaudible">who do so</supplied> will be youthful.</p>
      <p n="3" corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: <supplied reason="subaudible">their are</supplied> the shadows of the ten holy virtues <supplied reason="explanation">saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila</supplied>, the reflections of the ten holy paths <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga</foreign></supplied>, the manifestations of the ten sense organs <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>dasa-indriya</foreign></supplied>, what is needed to make the mundane world and the present world prosperous.</p> 
      <p n="4" corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the mundane world prosperous: roads being well-lit, plantations being large, superior, <supplied reason="subaudible">but also</supplied> the side <supplied reason="subaudible">yard</supplied> being clean, the front yard being well-lit. Moreover, the house being full, the rice barn is full, the chicken coop being full, the dry rice-field being cultivated, the tap <supplied reason="subaudible">of palm trees</supplied> being protected. The result is a life full of vitality, a long-lasting health, youthfulness of the ruler <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign></supplied>. Even in the mundane <supplied reason="subaudible">world</supplied>, grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes — all grown with fresh green leaves <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>hejo lembok</foreign></supplied>, all trees bearing fruit, falling fertile rains, growing seasonal crops; <supplied reason="subaudible">those</supplied> will bring life for many people.

       <p n="5" corresp="#skk_01.05">These are the ten accomplishments, considered as the shadow of the ten good conducts. It is the reflection of the ten paths, the manifestation of the ten organs.</p> 
       <p n="6" corresp="#skk_01.06">This is its explanation. Ears should not listen randomly <supplied reason="subaudible">to a discussion</supplied>, if it is not fit to be listened to. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>mala</foreign></supplied>, the payment <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>lunas</foreign></supplied> is punishment <supplied reason="subaudible">in</supplied> hell.

But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the mouth is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="12" corresp="#skk_01.12">The hands should not grasp randomly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But they are used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the hands is considered optimal.</p>
        <p n="13" corresp="#skk_01.13">The feet should not step randomly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if they are used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the feet is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="14" corresp="#skk_01.14">The anus should not be used rumblingly. For <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of calamity, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the anus is considered optimal.</p> 
        <p n="15" corresp="#skk_01.15">The vulva and the penis should not be used for seducing, for <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied> is the gate of misfortune, the payment is punishment in hell. But if it is used appropriately, the result <supplied reason="explanation">obtained</supplied> from the vulva and the penis is considered best. This is what is called the ten accomplishments.</p>

My veneration <supplied reason="subaudible">goes</supplied> to the Holy Five tathagatas!’ Pañca means five, tata means sound, gata means passion. Those are which will become a virtue, all of them. The five syllables <supplied reason="explanation">pañcaksara</supplied> are the masters of men. The meaning is: the five syllables are manifest, being  seen, experienced, observed by the senses. The master is the one to be asked by the people. That is why they are called the masters of men. As for ignorance, <supplied reason="subaudible">it exists</supplied> since the world exists.</p>
