    <p n="1" corresp="#skk_01.01">Here, as follows, is what will be taught by the holy man: the way <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>de</foreign></supplied> of one who searches weal. As regards what are called the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu <supplied reason="explanation">saṅ hyaṅ Siksa Kandaṅ Karəsian</supplied>, all people should exert themselves <supplied reason="subaudible">to follow them</supplied>. These are the words of the holy man, revealing the holy precepts from the hermitage milieu.</p>
     <p n="2" corresp="#skk_01.02">These are the ten holy accomplishments <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-krəta</foreign></supplied>, which must be adhered to by all people. Anyone who starts to uphold the holy instructions of the accomplishments <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>sasana krəta</foreign></supplied>, is destined to be long-lived, to be of long youth, to have success in paddy fields <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kuras</foreign></supplied>, to have success in cultivation, to stand firm, to win in battle — all people <supplied reason="subaudible">who do so</supplied> will be youthful.</p>
      <p n="3" corresp="#skk_01.03">This is the explanation of the ‘Ten Holy Accomplishments’: <supplied reason="subaudible">their are</supplied> the shadows of the ten holy virtues (saṅ hyaṅ dasa-sila), the reflections of the ten holy paths <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ dasa-marga</foreign></supplied>, the manifestations of the ten sense organs <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>dasa-indriya</foreign></supplied>, what is needed to make the mundane world and the present world prosperous.</p> 
      <p n="4" corresp="#skk_01.04">This is what we need to make the mundane world prosperous: roads being well-lit, plantations being large, superior, <supplied reason="subaudible">but also</supplied> the side <supplied reason="subaudible">yard</supplied> being clean, the front yard being well-lit. Moreover, the house being full, the rice barn is full, the chicken coop being full, the dry rice-field being cultivated, the tap <supplied reason="subaudible">of palm trees</supplied> being protected. The result is a life full of vitality, a long-lasting health, youthfulness of the ruler <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ mavaṅ rat</foreign></supplied>. Even in the mundane <supplied reason="subaudible">world</supplied>, grasses, trees, climbing plants, bushes — all grown with fresh green leaves <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>hejo lembok</foreign></supplied>, all trees bearing fruit, falling fertile rains, growing seasonal crops; [those] will bring life for many people. That is what is called the holy instructions of accomplishment <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>saṅ hyaṅ sasana krəta</foreign></supplied> in the mundane world. </p>
       <p n="5" corresp="#skk_01.05">These are the ten accomplishments, considered as the shadow of the ten good conducts. It is the reflection of the ten paths, the manifestation of the ten organs.</p> 
       <p n="6" corresp="#skk_01.06">This is its explanation. Ears should not listen randomly [to a discussion], if it is not fit to be listened to. For [this] is the gate of calamity, the reason we encounter misfortune (mala), the payment (lunas) is punishment [in] hell. But if they are used appropriately, then the result, [obtained] from the ears, is considered optimal.</p>
