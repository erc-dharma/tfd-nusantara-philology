                           <p>Palm-leaf manuscript. 121 leaves in Balinese script. <q>The order of the pages (lontars) is erratic, as mentioned earlier. Every lontar has 4 lines, except lontar 6 which seems to be a copy of lontar 11, and lontar 121, which has only 2 lines. The script is beautiful and clear, and comes out very well in the photographic copy, but the edges are mostly dark. Apart from that some lontars are damaged by age, i.e. lontar 9, 10, 14, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 41, 42, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 63, and 64. Severely damaged are lontar 11, 12, 45, and 46. Almost one third of these lontars is blank. No marginal notes are found, but the erratic order of the lontars gives evidence, that it is interfered with.</q>

<note>magiba-gibah avidva-vidvana. Z. 1.523 is doubtful in his rendering of the word gibah as 'a kind of shawl or wrap’, perhaps influenced by J  which has kleed? I think, it does not fit in our context. Therefore I regard the word gibah as a possible variety of gubah (to compose garlands) and translate the phrase accordingly.</note>

				I think, J. is closer to the original meaning. In Javanese, the basahan is mostly used by kings and princes etc while in great ornate attire or going to battle. King Krəṣṇa at this state is going to Kuṇḍina to face both, a wedding ceremony  which might turn into battle.-->

	The explanation of Z is more fitting here. I render it as 'reading aloud’. Perhaps the Javanese word is sigrak  which means 'elated’ as  well as 'keen’.
 	bhagañjiṅ. Z.I.185 renders it as 'a kind of building (in the compound of a sanctuary?).  Is it a place where books are kept and read’ The question mark reflects Zoetmulder’s doubt. I feel bhagañjiṅ should have some bearings with bhagavān (hermit), as añjiṅ in Javanese means 'to enter’ or literally 'to go into’ (daləm). Daləm can also mean residence, house. Hence I render bhagañjiṅ with hermitage.</app> -->

<note>smara samaya śr̥ṅgararacana (love, union and loveplay).   Z. II.1 799 reads smarasamaya and renders it with intercourse in love or the right time for love? He translates śr̥ṅgara into '1. love, sexual passion or desire or enjoyment; dress suitable for amorous purposes, elegant dress; 2. lovely; pretty; seductive’ (II.1816). On the other hand I regard śr̥ṅgararacana as a compound and render it with ornament (racana) of sexual passion (śr̥ṅgara),  which in combination with smara and samaya (love and union) cannot be anything else than love-play.</note>

I think manta is derived from matta (drunk; crazy) in the sense of dumb-founded. Hence my translation 'overwhelmed’.</app> -->

Here there is mention of two people wearing the same clothes, standing very close together etc, so that they cannot be seen as two people of different gender, except that one of them is wearing a rod of withering young coconut leaves  which reveals that she is a woman. This kind of scene is very common in Javanese literature, from Old Javanese to Javanese, e.g. in the Sərat Cənthini. In the RK, the behaviour of the crowd welcoming Rāma and Sītā back in Ayodhyā, is comparable with the above mentioned, e.g. RK 26.22 in translation reads as follows: ... The multitude was tumultuous, they jostled one another, they were affected by the sight of the king and queen loving each other. Some were offering garlands  which could not be forwarded as they were pushed from behind. They turned angrily to those pushing them, asking them to stop, but in vain. Others were looking at one another, very much in love and were turned on, when they were pinched and poked, their breasts molested. ...</app> -->

Especially the hairknot of a bride has a special name and style. See e.g. 'Upacara mantu karaton Surakarta', in Relung Pustaka, Augustus 1980. In Bali, the young unmarried girl is still recognizable by the style of hairknot, namely the end of the hair is hanging loosely down, while that of the married woman has its end turned inside.</app> -->

I suspect that akilusū ruyuṅ is another game of the girls like the asuhun-suhun huvi game which is accompanied by the tune Paman Doblang. The keyword here is akilusū  which sounds so close to sluku-sluku bathok. This sluku-sluku bathok game is performed as follows: The girls are sitting in a circle with their legs stretched forward. Their two hands move forward and back, as if massaging the legs. They move from one leg to the other, while singing "Sluku-sluku bathok, bathoke ela-elo etc". So, sluku-sluku seems to be a corrupt form of akilusu (tired) and the way they play the game we can see that they act like being very tired. Because of the movements of the hands, the kain of the girls are usually rolled up, revealing the calf of legs as mentioned in the 4th line (vətis ikābuṅah amaḍa puḍak...,</app> -->

Princes had also sons of the nobility as companions, beside older minders or servants. Even in the Rāmāyana kakavin these minders are already mentioned, e.g. RK. 23.37:
	Vvara rākṣasottama ṅaranya kampana akampanākhya nipuṇa,

	<!--<app><!-\-note for the reading-\->Z. I.972 renders lampuran with 'probably travelling singer or player’. This meaning does not fit in the context of the stanza above. I remember, that even today in Central Java especially, in the early evening hours, people sometimes hear noises of ringing bells, and then respond with beating everything that can produce loud noise, such as empty gasoline tins, wooden drums etc while shouting 'lampor, lampor’. G&amp;R II.149 explains that lampor is "a name of an evil spirit, which according to superstitions is sent by the goddess of the South (Ratu Kidul)...etc.”</app> -->
	<!--<app><!-\-note for the reading-\->It is interesting to note that lamp or, as the story goes, is not only a messenger of the Queen of the South (Seas), but also her retinue when she is travelling to visit the kings of Java. What is most interesting here is the association of lampor with the Ratu Kidul, who is the Virgin Goddess or Kanyā Kumārī in India. If this is true, then the lampuran tower should be a structure or building where offerings to the goddess Kanyā Kumārī are placed and where she is worshipped perhaps by would-be brides, as part of the wedding ceremonies. Krəṣṇāyana kakavin mentions that at the pamidudukan ceremony, Princess Rukmiṇī went to a pavillion to worship the Goddess of Love (canto 36), but in the Sanskrit sources it is told that she is abducted by King Krəṣṇa on her way back to the palace, after she worships the Mother-goddess.</app> -->

	<note> Z. reads hana līlāsobag hanan acatu len taṅ nita parih, and renders catu with 1. share, part, portion. 2. It seems to be a kind of game, played by women... It is not clear what game is meant. (I.312); nita with game, playing for a stake (I.1199) and parih with probably falling of the dice, decision in a contest, the person who casts the dice or give the decision (II.1298). G &amp; R. II.219 has parah which means taker, lovah, sigar, paṅkat, meten (to measure, decease, share, divide, grade).
	I think acatu and nita parih are two kind of games, very popular amongst the woman-folk in the palace. Acatu derived from a- (prefix) and catu is so close to catur (chess-game)  which it seems already existed in ancient times. In the wayang stories
	however, thc chess-game in Indian stories becomes a dice-game, i.e. in the story of Yudhiṣṭhira playing chess is transformed into playing dice (main dhadhu) in the vayaṅ story.
	I understand nita parih as a game, based on arithmetic. Indeed in Java, there is such a game called ḍakon. The game is played on a block of wood with two rows of holes, usually 5 on each side, and a bigger hole on each end. The bigger holes are called lumbung (rice-bam). The other holes are filled with stones (5 or any number). The player takes the stones from one hole on her side and distributes them to the other holes including her own lumbung, with the exception of her opponent's. Every time she casts the last stone in a hole with stones, she can continue to play, but if the last stone falls in an empty hole on the opponent's side, it is dead. The opponent then gets her turn to play. However if the last stone falls in an empty hole on the player's side, opposite her opponent's hole with stones, it is called mbedil (shooting). She can take all the stones of her opponent in that particular hole to be deposited in her lumbung. The act of shooting can be dramatised by a thunderous "bang". Just then the opponent gets her turn to play. The game finishes with no stones left on one side. The player with the most stones wins the game.</note>

In Java, Sunda etc this test is usually conducted at a ceremony called "nontoni" (to see) in Javanese. Some delegates, including the groom to be, pay a visit to the girl's family, where they are entertained with a meal, with a.o. the sambal and lalab prepared by the bride to be. She has also to serve the guests. During the meal, the visitors, especially the groom to be, have ample opportunity to evaluate everything about the bride to be.

Zoetmulder's II.2054 supposition that tulak tala is 'an instrument or weapon to repel a hostile śakti’ is perhaps based on the meaning of tala (death), so that tulak tala is in fact a formula for survival. The Javanese term at present is tulak bilahi. If we render the phrase in the K.Y. as such, it is acceptable to me, in the sense that Rukmiṇī does not want to go to sleep with the pretence to repel harmful influence that may come from hostile parties.  However, I prefer the meaning 'earth, ground’ for tala in the sense that Rukmiṇi just refuses to lie down, to sleep, because she worries too much.</app> -->

<ab xml:id="krsnayana_02.01.01" corresp="#krsnayana_01.01.01">May there be no disturbances!</ab>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.01.02" corresp="#krsnayana_01.01.02" n="1"> At the copper age Lord Wiṣṇu descended on earth as a human being. Nowhere else than in the parwas would the story be described as an act of one who imbibed [the knowledge]. It is believed that the opening hymn is capable to purify all the impurities of the listeners and to establish the mind of the poet to keep writing the book.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.01.03" corresp="#krsnayana_01.01.03" n="2"> Then let me be given the hope to be able to increase the beauty by  elaborating on the story, so that it can be likened to a sprout of the gaḍuṅ-plant‚ eagerly waiting for the drops of rain to fall. Then after a while of showers and aroused by thunder, it starts to grow a little and when it is fully grown, it will have many branches, leaves and flowers, giving rise to wonder [in the hearts] of those who see.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.01.04" corresp="#krsnayana_01.01.04" n="3"> However let me not be charmed too quickly by the [expectations] of such beauty, because there are yet a great deal to be done [to reveal] the beauty. It is like the bumble-bee, wondering through the bushes of asana-flowers while searching for honey, without regard to the cold and gusty wind or cowered by dew or burnt by the sun. Its only purpose that matters is to get the essence of the flowers and that is honey.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.01.05" corresp="#krsnayana_01.01.05" n="4"> Because the road to the mastering of the art of story-writing is difficult like scaling a mountain. The stress and strain [in connection with the writing] of a poem must be overcome and brought under control, because it is not a pleasure trip [through a garden of roses]. It is like scaling a mountain, hardship and tiredness have to be faced, in order to find satisfaction, as the result of leaning on a pen as on a walking-stick and wandering along the valleys of the writing-pad.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.01.06" corresp="#krsnayana_01.01.06" n="5"> Although [the life of] a poet is that hard, yet I do not want to leave it, because I want to meet the call of my heart. Also my adoration to Lord Wiṣṇu who had lead me to worship [him], by composing the story of Lord Krəṣṇa's wedding to Princess Rukmiṇī. Perhaps the feeling is like this, which is felt by people of elevated souls.</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="2" xml:id="krsnayana_02.02">


<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.02.01" corresp="#krsnayana_01.02.01" n="1"> There was an extremely beautiful capital city, very well-planned which explained its intense beauty, known as the capital city of Dwārawatī. It was formerly a village located near the ocean, newly built into an excellent city, famous for its affluence and good life,  well-established down to its gates. Furthermore, the reigning ruler was called Garuḍadhwaja (the bearer of the garuḍa-banner), known to the  world as Lord Krəṣṇa.</p>



		
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.02.02" corresp="#krsnayana_01.02.02" n="2"> However there was one impediment for the kingdom, in the form of the most powerful king of Yawana. The news was around that he had received a boon from God Rudra, that he would never be killed in battle by a member of the Yadu race. Therefore he [the king of Yawana] wanted to attack King Krəṣṇa forcefully, with his amazing host of demons, hundreds of thousands in number, together with vehicles and elephants.</p>



		
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.02.03" corresp="#krsnayana_01.02.03" n="3"> Then he [King Krəsṇa] used his mastery of dharma (religious knowledge) and yoga (communion with the Supreme Deity) as defence against the enemy in the form of demons. He did not face the enemy in battle; instead he fled away, not because of fear, but because he had in mind an excellent strategy. He took his refuge with Priest Mucukunda, who was asleep in a cave on the slopes of the Himawān mountain. He hid himself under the couch of the great priest, looking for protection.</p>



			
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.02.04" corresp="#krsnayana_01.02.04" n="4"> Not a minute later, the king of Yawana burst into the cave (of the mountain) in pursuit. He saw Priest Mucukunda, but his eyes and intellect were blinded into deceit. "Eey‚ son of Basudewa, you are deceitful, because you remain silent and do not utter a word. It is not allowed for a powerful hero to kill an opponent whilst he is asleep".</p>



			
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.02.05" corresp="#krsnayana_01.02.05" n="5"> So he said, stepped forward and gave [the sleeping man] a kick. Let us relate the priest who was suddenly awakened. He was startled and looked very angry and fierce, his eyebrows moved creating furrows on his forehead, out of anger. From his eyes fire issued forth which turned into viṣānala (poisonous fire), flaring and flaming amazingly. It was exactly like the eyes of God Iśwara which issued fire to burn the god of love.</p>



				
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.02.06" corresp="#krsnayana_01.02.06" n="6"> Roaring and flaring highly it enveloped King Kālayawana and set him ablaze together with his host and vehicles. They were annihilated, burnt to ashes without a single survival. Then King Krəṣṇa came out quickly to pay homage at the feet of the great priest, whose mind turned spotless clear once more. His anger disappeared like image in water.</p>



			
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.02.07" corresp="#krsnayana_01.02.07" n="7"> They looked friendly, because they were happy to meet each other and conversing amiably; they came out of the cave. Let us leave them. After the conversation they bade each other farewell. The perfect sage returned to his contemplation in remembrance of God Śiwa. In short, he returned to the abode of the gods and ceased to be in a human form.</p>
    
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.02.08" corresp="#krsnayana_01.02.08" n="8">On the other hand. King Krəṣṇa made his vay back to his country in a delightful journey. Women, jewels etc were captured and taken as booty from the city of Yawana. All the Yadu people were in glea and joy, because they found happiness in the bliss of their protector.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="3" xml:id="krsnayana_02.03">

	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.01" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.01" n="1"> When King Krəṣṇa came back safe and sound, he planned to beautify his capital city. The region of Dwāravatī was once again purified with mantras, prayers and hymns, bad and auspicious times were taken into consideration by the great astrologers. The star [chosen] was Rohiṇī, signifying good [fortune] and victory. Thus was the verdict concerning the time [found in the scriptures].</p>



	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.02" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.02" n="2"> Thus the purification ceremony of the capital city was performed to perfection, so that the whole kingdom of Dwārawatī became firmly secured. An excellent builder by the name of Wiśwakarmmā, an architect of the gods who was renowned in the art of carving, came.</p>



		
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.03" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.03" n="3"> Soon a beautiful palace for the king was built by Wiśwakarmmā, with great five aspects in all kinds of excellent finish. The audience hall, together with the royal square were already built strong and attractive. It was ten times better in style and refinement than before.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.04" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.04" n="4"> Its only fault was that it [the royal square], was rather narrow and too close to the sea. Also the roaring and thundering sound of the breakers falling unto the rocks was loud beyond comparison. These were the reasons that God Baruṇa was summoned by King Krəṣṇa, to  which he obliged very quickly. He did not object to withdraw the flow of the water of the sea [a bit further back].</p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.05" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.05" n="5"> So the line of the coast was drawn back and the soil perfectly hardened and cleared. It became an appealing spot, because a busy market was founded there under the shades of bodhi, tangtang and banyan trees. A big river flowiṅ dangerously from the hills was perfectly dyked off [on both sides] with stones, increasing the boundaries of the palace compound. The area of the audience hall was nice and enthralling.</p>
				
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.06" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.06" n="6">The walls around the city were thick and strong; the inhabitants were harmonious in their propensities and the officials were staunchly judicious, e.g. Kaswa, Uddhawa, Wikaddha, Anadrəsya were always prudent and of excellent behaviour. Also the brahmins were paramount in the knowledge of the holy scriptures (Wedas) and highly dexterous in their expertise.
 </p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.07" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.07" n="7"> So the administration buildings were always busy and emissaries from foreign countries were coming and going. The devout ministers as well as the religious clergy in the mountains were  well-trained horsemen. There was no horse throughout the region of Dwārakā  which was without walls, and all the wagons and horses had their own places.</p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.08" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.08" n="8">It was a pity that not all the subjects were contented: some were poor, because there were too many people. They made a representation at the feet of King Krəṣṇa asking for an increase of income, causing anxiety to the king. The Śaiwa and Buddhist priests made also a representation to the king with a report that they did not have enough means to live on, and so urging the king to give them more assistance.
 </p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.09" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.09" n="9"> That was the reason that the god of wealth (Dhanādhipa) was summoned by King Krəṣṇa (Surendrānuja) and was ordered to shower wealth to give the people means to live. Jewels and precious stones then poured down from the sky, and the people throughout the kingdom were in delight and praised [the king] vehemently. Indeed it was the gift of the generous god of wealth (Weśrawaṇa) (who gave them the gold and silver).</p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.03.10" corresp="#krsnayana_01.03.10" n="10"> There was an audience hall of the deities, famed to be the house of communion of the gods. It was said, that King Krəṣṇa decided it to be transfered to Dwārawatī. God Bāyu was given the job, and surely soon the hall arrived, brought over by a gusty wind.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="4" xml:id="krsnayana_02.04">	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.04.01" corresp="#krsnayana_01.04.01" n="1"> Then there in the middle of the city the audience hall Sudharma was placed. The building was really outstanding and the nice carvings were immensely appealing. Everything there had never been seen before; and because they were brought from heaven, they were fabulous. Indeed [Dwārawatī] was not inferior to the abode of Hari, in the reign of King Krəṣṇa.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.04.02" corresp="#krsnayana_01.04.02" n="2"> The palace was perfect, its crown was made of black stone and the doorways were large and marvellous. The walls and gates were carved extensively all around with the story of the crowing of the handsome Rāma. The statues of the door-guards were awe-inspiring, placed nicely here and there, as if really alive, (The hearts of) those seeing them would be in fear, because [the guards] seemed to forbid them to enter [the palace] for audience.</p>


<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.04.03" corresp="#krsnayana_01.04.03" n="3"> There were big murals of mountains with beautiful sceneries and merus on the walls of houses, that were built in the heart of the palace compound. Beneath it, there was a peacock, relaxing on a roof [of a building], mostly becoming, increasing its refinement.   The garden was ringed with a wall shapely topped with cement. On a bench there was a cuckatoo chattering ceaselessly and moving around freely.</p>

		
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.04.04" corresp="#krsnayana_01.04.04" n="4">Likewise was the temple for the god of wealth, Dhanendra [decorated] ‚ built with pillars of hard and shining kostubha stones. The glitter of the blue saphires and padma-rāga–stones at the joints of the shingles and rafters shone everywhere. The roof was in tiers, shining greenish like young teak wood. Worshippers became softhearted, as [the temple] was like burning in the flame of all the precious stones.
 </p>

				
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.04.05" corresp="#krsnayana_01.04.05" n="5"> Water issued furiously from  wells nearby  which were spraying the nāgapuspa-trees. The dykes [of the  wells] were made of big stones, nicely arranged like flowers. The water seemed to come out of a hidden spring and the gravel was tossed and thrashed [all the time]. The reflexion of the trees was feebly flashed away by the movement of the water.</p>



		
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.04.06" corresp="#krsnayana_01.04.06" n="6">It was lonely and shady at the east of the prāsāda (offerings-place)  which was cowered by jəring and dewataru-trees. This is the place where the king used to pray, respectfully worshipping the image of God Wiṣṇu. He always came at the beginning of the month and at full moon to pray [here]. This is the behaviour of those who have mercy on the  world, namely to be firm in religion without reservation.
 </p>






	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.04.07" corresp="#krsnayana_01.04.07" n="7"> A bridge with a roof was specially built extending towards a beauteous island, intended as a resort of entertainments. The glow of the jina-maṇi, studded on the eaves was twinkling everywhere in the water below. flowers  which bloomed in the night were arranged thickly on its roof, looking like fireflies [swarming into the light], but the leaves of the cāmara-tree swept [the flowers] away, as they moved to and fro blown by the wind.</p>



			
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.04.08" corresp="#krsnayana_01.04.08" n="8"> Then there was an amusement park  which should be described in poetry as the wood and valleys were really fabulous, [because] the knowledge of King Krəṣṇa about all kinds of trees and waterplants was renowned to be like that of a bee almost caught [in a trap] by its eagerness towards a flower before blooming. The bee seemed to flutter around, so keen and desirous of all kinds of fragrance.</p>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="5" xml:id="krsnayana_02.05">

				
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.05.01" corresp="#krsnayana_01.05.01" n="1"> It was as if the trees just woke up [from their slumber], as their branches were winding around each other disorderly. The pretty nagasari and bakung-flowers aroused delight, [because] they seemed to be the blessing for this victorious city. The wungu-flowerplants had aśoka-flowers, whilst the asoka-tree was like crazy as it bore wungu-buds. The jangga-creepers had katirah-leaves hanging downwards; on the other hand the katirah bore gaḍung-flowers.</p>

The gandharva mode of marriage is based on mutual agreement between the bride and groom, but it does not always receive the approval of other parties. Hence perhaps classified as something beyond the rules (apakrama). Rukma abuses Krəṣṇa about his behaviour, but not of the gandharvavivāha. Krəṣṇa himself does not regard his marriage as a gandharvavivahā, but a marriage through power or combat (valātkāra) which is regarded as the highest mode of marriage for a kṣatriya. See Krəṣṇāyana 52.7 which reads yan bvat kṣatriyajanma vīryya panukunya śura maṅgāpraṅa (however for a man from the kṣatriya-caste, the dowry is power and the will to fight courageously). This attitude is in fact in accordance with what Devabrata says in the Ādiparva (ed. Juynboll, p.98)  which reads: Ai bhūmipāla, kita sahananiṅ ratu milu riṅ svayambara! ...

For a king, a marriage  which is the result of valātkāra (use of force) is the best of all kinds of marriage. Because it is so, I will apply that marriage by force, and therefore I take these three girls. Whoever disapproves (or is angry), he can meet me in battle. Be careful!)</note></p>

She left without waiting for her maid to accompany her, who ran after her. Still she did not stop. Her fragrant smelling kain flew in the wind, exposing the calf of her legs  which resembled pandanus flowers. Her pretty shawl was like a book [of lontar leaves] held under the arm touching her breasts.</p>



				
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.25.12" corresp="#krsnayana_01.25.12" n="12"> Then when she already arrived at the look-out to wait for [the guest] just coming, her behaviour and mind were very proper. She sat with her arms straight down to her thighs. Moaning she struck on her head with her elbows, taking care of not smashing her eyebrovs. Because of her affliction she took so much care of her eyelashes to be in line with [the curves of her] eyebrows.</p>



				
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.25.13" corresp="#krsnayana_01.25.13" n="13"> Another lady looked also great, in beauty her equal was nothing less than a lake full of lotuses. When she threw a glance, the smile seemed to go with it, imitating the pollen of the day-lotus. The leaves of the blue lotus were like her kain blowing in the wind. She acted so sweet, swayiṅ while complaining of weariness, like a swan riding on the ripples of water.</p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.26.05" corresp="#krsnayana_01.26.05" n="5"> All of them were affected by love-sickness, not even one was not looking for fulfilment. The flame of desire was hidden in a friendly appearance, like the detachment of a sātvika (vise man). They pretended to be hermits, but they were caught [in the ajct] of throwing glances.

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.27.05" corresp="#krsnayana_01.27.05" n="5"> As for the danger of his visit to express his congratulations should be realized. At the time that he entered the living quarters of the princess to pay his respect and be entertained by her, the beautiful one (Rukmiṇī) would be so close to the handsome one (Krəṣṇa), and that might inspire desire.

[On the other hand] the passion of the son of Basudeva (Krəṣṇa) was as big as a mountain, how should be not be restless.

The flower of the pandanus was matching straight calf of legs just being washed.

In the middle was a building in the form of a meru, tall like a mountain of gold. The draperies resembling the clouds were flying in the wind, giving rise to tender feelings. The creepers [made of chains of] pearls bore the resemblance of the water of the fountain.

There were people who came in extraordinary vehicles [not usually] for transporting human beings, because they wanted to arrive quickly. Others were walking accompanied by their wives striding ahead.

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.32.08" corresp="#krsnayana_01.32.08" n="8"> There were a multitude of stalls [exhibiting merchandise or amusements]. One of them attracted a [large] group of people. They went to see a mask-dance, then moved further to the vocalists stalls. It is the nature of people from the rural areas that they got easily stupefied at what they saw. They pointed enthusiastically at everything they saw, they were even delighted to see a banner.</p>

The priest cut the ceremony short, because he was afraid of the big crowd. He rang the bell frantically while pronouncing the formulae of redemption.</p>



	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.32.10" corresp="#krsnayana_01.32.10" n="10"> It was already late when the princess wearing her woollen attire departed hurriedly, accompanied by the wives of high-ranking officials and those‚ wantiṅ to make their audience in the palace.

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.33.02" corresp="#krsnayana_01.33.02" n="2"> Her hairknot was so attractive, overlaid by ornaments of gold and precious stones, e.g. a səkar-taji flower [of gold] shaped like a lotus with extremely sharp points. When it reflected the glitter of the ūrṇṇā (a jewellery at the top of the hair-knot), its beautiful rays were so sweet, increasing the refinement of her face, boosted by the shape of her  well-formed shoulders.</p>

Furthermore passion came to torture [her] ‚ like darkness arriving to enter [her mind]. She longed for King Krəṣṇa and hated the king of Cedī lands. That tender feelings [toward King Krəṣṇa] and enmity [towards the king-of Cedī] were raging inside, each one trying to subdue the other.</p>



	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.33.15" corresp="#krsnayana_01.33.15" n="15"> The maidservants, beautiful wives of officials, were always at the side of the princess, trying to console her mind as they knew very  well how to serve [the mistress]. All their actions [were aimed] to make her happy, e.g. they were sveet and entertaining or playing chess or dakon.
<note>Z. reads hana līlāsobag hanan acatu len taṅ nita parih, and renders catu with 1. share, part, portion. 2. It seems to be a kind of game, played by women... It is not clear what game is meant. (I.312); nita with game, playing for a stake (I.1199) and parih with probably falling of the dice, decision in a contest, the person who casts the dice or give the decision (II.1298). G &amp; R. II.219 has parah which means taker, lovah, sigar, paṅkat, meten (to measure, decease, share, divide, grade).
I think acatu and nita parih are two kind of games, very popular amongst the woman-folk in the palace. Acatu derived from a- (prefix) and catu is so close to catur (chess-game)  which it seems already existed in ancient times. In the wayang stories
however, thc chess-game in Indian stories becomes a dice-game, i.e. in the story of Yudhiṣṭhira playing chess is transformed into playing dice (main dhadhu) in the vayaṅ story.
I understand nita parih as a game, based on arithmetic. Indeed in Java, there is such a game called ḍakon. The game is played on a block of wood with two rows of holes, usually 5 on each side, and a bigger hole on each end. The bigger holes are called lumbung (rice-bam). The other holes are filled with stones (5 or any number). The player takes the stones from one hole on her side and distributes them to the other holes including her own lumbung, with the exception of her opponent's. Every time she casts the last stone in a hole with stones, she can continue to play, but if the last stone falls in an empty hole on the opponent's side, it is dead. The opponent then gets her turn to play. However if the last stone falls in an empty hole on the player's side, opposite her opponent's hole with stones, it is called mbedil (shooting). She can take all the stones of her opponent in that particular hole to be deposited in her lumbung. The act of shooting can be dramatised by a thunderous "bang". Just then the opponent gets her turn to play. The game finishes with no stones left on one side. The player with the most stones wins the game.</note></p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.56.03" corresp="#krsnayana_01.56.03" n="3"> Thw women whether they talked to each other in earnest or not, agreed that the king was extremely lucky indeed. So, they prayed, may they love each other forever and may Princess Rukmiṇī bear children soon.</p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.57.01" corresp="#krsnayana_01.57.01" n="1"> It is impossible to relate everything. So both of them retreated to the bridal chamber. They broke their fasting of love and passion was given free reign. Clearly they seemed to give away their intention to make asceticism.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.57.02" corresp="#krsnayana_01.57.02" n="2"> The king was an expert in striviṅ for excellence,  which he had been doiṅ since a long time in the past. In the bedroom he was absorbed in all activities, but like a blind, be often made mistakes.</p>

<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.01" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.01" n="1"> Time passed. Their marriage was a success, but let us not talk about it. Her yearning towards her parents was superseded by love towards her husband. Also she could preoccupy herself with the beauty of the ornaments of the capital city, as everything was fabulous like the beauty of the palaces of the gods.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.02" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.02" n="2"> There was a royal palace beautifully built by a demi-god architect at an isolated spot. It was built for the quarters of the ladies and richly ornamented with carvings. There were many golden statues, newly delivered. The shoots of the katirah creepers on the eves were growing strongly reaching the rafters of the roof.</p>



		
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.03" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.03" n="3"> That was the place where the king and the princess lived in harmony, enjoying their love together and sharing their passion of consummation, satisfying the need of the senses in their worship of the god of love. All the instructions contained in the book Pradyumnagama were remembered and brought into practice.</p>



			
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.04" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.04" n="4"> In fact, why should they not be in love with each other, since they have the same good looks? They matched each other. All the emotional affairs of love that gave the marriage a sour taste never arose, both were very keen to perform everything suitable under the cover of blankets. Watching the girl sweating, the heart of the king seemed to melt.</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.05" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.05" n="5"> Who would not be delighted to see them so blitheful in their marriage. They were both gorgeous and in full bloom like a cool wash with fragrant sandalwood [ointment]. They were attached to each other like drink-water with syrup. They were always together as if of one soul like the container with the sacred sugar.</p>



			
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.06" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.06" n="6"> It is impossible to relate all what they did to share their harmonious life together. Once they went to the garden for a walk together joyfully. They went everywhere, to quiet places, walking or playing hide and seek or looking for a pandanus flower to lead them towards nice occupations in the resthouse.</p>



	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.07" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.07" n="7"> Also everything in the little forest was full of charm. From a hole in a hill, water flowed down and became a creek. On both sides stones and sand were marvellously arranged. Its sands were fragrant, the surabhi flowers gave it to them as a means to welcome [the king and the princess].</p>



	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.08" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.08" n="7"> The flowing water of the river looked pure like a virgin, kuluma fishes were swimming at the side as quick as the mind. The slugs were leading each other, never misunderstanding each other, though they were cowered with red shells. They moved very slowly as if they were just stretching [their body].</p>
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.09" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.09" n="9"> There was a nice offerings-house with tall fountains and clear water, located beside a pond which was like a lake full of all kinds of flowers. The branches of the aśokas and punnāgas were rubbing and touching each other, the roots were stuck so closely resembling people embracing each other passionately.</p>



	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.10" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.10" n="10"> The creeping pandanus on the sides of the lake looked beautiful, the leaf-scars on its trunk seemed to look as if half of its waist-hand was taken off. There were two flowers laying on each side of a rock, its beauty gave rise to yearning as they resembled the calf of legs of [a girl] sitting on the lap [of her lover].</p>



	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.11" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.11" n="11"> So the garden was like a maru (a co-wife of the king) to the princess. The bees were always buzzing like [the maru] was crying and sobbing. A caterpillar was hanging on to the eve, unseen, because nobody was interested in it. The ants in the pond were pitiful, because they fell in the hole of crocodiles.</p>



	
<p xml:id="krsnayana_02.58.12" corresp="#krsnayana_01.58.12" n="12"> At the east-side there was a little pavillion with a couch, intentionally built for quietness and isolation. The handul flowers were thickly and widely spread all over the footpath. The tañjuṅ tree at the yard was imposing and nicely ringed with a wall, its flowers fell on the ground arousing passion in the hearts of those seeking [repose].</p>

Let us rather return to King Krəṣṇa and the princess. Their marriage was like the union of their eager souls, like arddhanāriśvara (the union of Śiva and Pārvatī). The husband loved his wife very much, and the princess was extremely devoted and loving to her husband.</p>

So, the purpose of writing [a scripture] and discussing the dharmma in meetings has been the destruction of perplexity in the mind, because from the mind originate the sins and they [can only] be destroyed by pure knowledge. 'Stilling the mind’ should always be kept in mind and practised by the sattwic (good) people without negligence. Let the essence of the most elevated knowledge (rasa surasa) in all the holy scriptures be given the highest attention.</ab>
