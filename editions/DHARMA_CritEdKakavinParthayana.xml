<div><p>May there be no hindrance! </p></div>
<div type="canto" n="1">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The supreme truth that flows from flawless aesthetic experience is brought to fulfilment by the existence of the poet.</l>
<l n="b">Absorbed in meditation, he finds harmony in the innermost part of his mind through unity with the rapturous beauty of the Lotus of Non-duality,</l>
<l n="c">And gives it visible form* in a <foreign>kakawin</foreign>, arranging it in lines, as the essence in the grooves [of the writing board] of the temple he builds with tendrils of beauty.</l>
<l n="d">Indeed, it is the subtle form of the spell which renders invisible the rising of love* and finally becomes inconceivable formlessness.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">For if the deity is praised according to the prescriptions, He becomes embodied in the beauty of sea and mountain.</l>
<l n="b">Clearly He merges with them, vanishing without trace into nothingness, inspiring the poetic sentiments that reach the ear.</l>
<l n="c">When the point of the stylus is completely worn away in the letters which form the black marks* on the writing board,</l>
<l n="d">In this way he, who in performing his act of worship, falls at His feet, frames his first praises.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Now I am enraptured, suddenly burdened with the desire to compose a poem* in homage to Beauty.</l>
<l n="b">But how can I possibly succeed? It can only bring great trouble. How can it be considered apposite?*</l>
<l n="c">For so deeply does the rumbling of the clouds stir me that I am compelled to take up writing board and stylus, </l>
<l n="d">Not cowering before the ignorance in my heart, but shamelessly and recklessly, longing only for skilfulness.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">When I ponder the evil nature of my fruitless existence, how cruel it seems. What can bring me contentment?</l>
<l n="b">Because wickedness is ever-present, filling me with sorrow, I have renounced the hope of ever being free of it.</l>
<l n="c">I secretly conceal my bewilderment and confusion, for there is no one to whom I can cry out for help, as I encounter the disfavour of fate.</l>
<l n="d">I want only to flee and dwell in a forest hermitage. There, alone, I may find peace.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">For any who seek such an end to wretchedness, there is the example* of the noble Arjuna,</l>
<l n="b">Who, when Dropadī was together with Yudhiṣṭhira, entered the inner chamber.</l>
<l n="c">This deed caused him such anguish that he, too, wanted nothing more than to go away and dwell in the forest, </l>
<l n="d">And seeking leave of the king, received his blessing before departing.</l></p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The next morning, just as the rising sun shone forth in the eastern sky, the prince made ready.</l>
<l n="b">Having completed his devotions, he then went out of the city,</l>
<l n="c">His only companions his arrows, bow and armour, for these were the excellent weapons he bore,</l>
<l n="d">As is in accordance with the code of the warrior and is the way of those who seek to serve the world through valour.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">As he journeyed swiftly and without hindrance away from the kingdom, he was welcomed* by the beauties of nature.</l>
<l n="b">He came upon many splendid gardens on the outskirts of the palace.</l>
<l n="c">The trees, wrapped in mist, seemed to weep sorrowfully, as they cried aloud in their grief,* overwhelmed with longing.</l>
<l n="d">The young leaves of the beautiful sugar palms hung down in profusion, spreading outwards as if sighing with longing, giving free rein to their flowing tears.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">The prince continued on his way, journeying further and further from the town.</l>
<l n="b">When he looked back, the place he had left behind had a dismal appearance and seemed despondent.</l>
<l n="c">Without lustre, dejectedly hiding its charms, it seemed to want to keep itself hidden under a veil of grey.</l>
<l n="d">The glow of the half-risen sun was a red haze, like the bright glance of a girl dulled by yearning.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Furthermore, the beauty along the delightful path he travelled, was the beauty of spring-time.</l>
<l n="b">Their freshness fading*, becoming limp, the tree branches tossed feverishly in the wind,</l>
<l n="c">Their rustling, the sighing plaint of a lover’s grief, their love for him unrequited.</l>
<l n="d">Their flowers, hanging down in abundance, fell to the ground all withered and lay scattered everywhere.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">There was* a young banyan tree and a number of fig trees rising on high, as well as <foreign>prih</foreign> and <foreign>bulu</foreign> trees.</l>
<l n="b">Everywhere, pecking birds thronged together, while yet others came flying through the air, darting to and fro amongst the trees.</l>
<l n="c">The mynah birds pretended to tease the parrots that joined them and drew near them respectfully.</l>
<l n="d">The voice of the <foreign>kuwong</foreign> sounded tremulously and was answered by the <foreign>walik,</foreign> lamenting that it had been abandoned by its mate, the <foreign>cucur.</foreign></l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">He arrived at the outlying districts where, in the fields on the mountain-slopes,</l>
<l n="b">Herders were tending their cattle, resting peacefully there, where land had been cleared for fields along the mountain ridges.</l>
<l n="c">Others were milking cows, for, since time immemorial, milk had been the produce that they took in homage to the palace</l>
<l n="d">At Indraprastha. Indeed, it is well known that this had always been their tribute and their prescribed duty.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">A rain-filled cloud had just loosed its rain, sprinkling it down on the settlements in the ravines.</l>
<l n="b">Little by little, the breeze drove away the mist, leaving behind only the glow of the sun.</l>
<l n="c">The love-sick <foreign>cātaka</foreign> bird became so steeped in melancholy, as the clouds dispersed and went away to the beauty of the hills, </l>
<l n="d">That it moved the prince to join with it, in looking dejectedly at the sky.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">Unhurriedly, he travelled on, passing by the forest pavilions.</l>
<l n="b">The many hermitages and holy places he came upon were, in his view, all magnificent,</l>
<l n="c">As indeed were all the religious abodes, foundations, monasteries and fine temples, quite splendid.</l>
<l n="d">Some time later, as the sun was setting, he came to the River Saraswatī.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">Truly spotless were its excellent and sacred waters used as the means of purification in these forest hermitages.</l>
<l n="b">Moreover, within the enclosing walls of the artificial ponds they had formed a shallow <foreign>madraka</foreign> lake* that was without fault.</l>
<l n="c">Its beautiful inlets formed a sculpted perimeter,* presenting to the beholder a vast array of lotus blossoms.</l>
<l n="d">As proof that its deep waters were without defect, they seemed to proclaim its perfection.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15"><l n="a">The prince's heart was filled with delight as he looked at the beauty of the great river.</l>
<l n="b">Reminiscent of the charms of the tossing ocean was the rippling of the water, lapping and billowing.</l>
<l n="c">A breeze gently touching them and lifting them into flashes of light,</l>
<l n="d">The waves danced gaily, full of joy at meeting the noble Arjuna.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="16"><l n="a">White swans glided here and there in the middle of the river* seeming to wander in pursuit of beauty.</l>
<l n="b">Charmed, they listened intently to the buzzing of the bees, gaily courting [the flowers].</l>
<l n="c">As if to tell them of the purity of the river, the wind held them captive, teasing them, tossing and turning them from side to side,</l>
<l n="d">But they just continued bathing, quite indifferent to the profusion of lotuses there, where they were wading.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="17"><l n="a">Across the pond in the shallow water, moving with studied grace,* </l>
<l n="b">A duck and its mate moved off whispering endearments to each other.</l>
<l n="c">They stayed there among the lotuses, happy in their love-making, causing a shower of pollen* to fall.</l>
<l n="d">How sad* that the blue lotuses, shaken to and fro, were crushed by their beating wings.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="18"><l n="a">The green banks seemed to have been beautifully adorned and ornamented</l>
<l n="b">With moss,* which looked as though it had been scratched and seemed, appropriately, to imitate a dusting of powder,</l>
<l n="c">And, like the shaved eyebrows of a beautiful girl, clearly aroused desire,</l>
<l n="d">While the <foreign>pakis ĕndah</foreign> fern in the water was like fragrant musk,* its perfume melting* away.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="19"><l n="a">Bees flew in circles in search of virgin delights in the entrancing beauty of the lotus.</l>
<l n="b">Eagerly swarming to and fro, going longingly from flower to flower* to caress them, brushed gently by the pollen.</l>
<l n="c">Their buzzing was like thunder in the fourth month, and their tender cries of victory were as gentle and graceful</l>
<l n="d">As the murmuring of sacred syllables, their gift of homage to the prince, to bring him constant delight.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="20"><l n="a">So he descended there, to wash his face and rinse his mouth in the ritual worship of the sun.</l>
<l n="b">His weariness vanished and when he had completed his devotions, his heart became all the more tranquil.</l>
<l n="c">Thereupon, he arose from the water, and again gave himself up to enjoyment, lying on a flat rock, </l>
<l n="d">And with delight, observed the shrimps that hid themselves behind the rocks and peeked out enticingly.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="21"><l n="a">Amused he watched the <foreign>pingul</foreign>-fish* playing far out in the water.</l>
<l n="b">They teased each other, darting so swiftly back and forth that some sought shelter* under the rocks.</l>
<l n="c">There was great confusion in the river when, with great caution, the timid catfish came out, one after the other,</l>
<l n="d">But then, startled, dashed for cover* into the marsh-land as the birds swooped down on them.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="22"><l n="a">Even more enchanting was the wondrous mountain stream, which seemed to merge* into the sky,</l>
<l n="b">And, in the setting sun, with wilted flowers scattered on the rippling water, </l>
<l n="c">It took on* the beauty of embroidered cloth, like a blanket of brilliant stars,</l>
<l n="d">And seemed to make a perfect flower obeisance, as if to say this is our offering* to you - or so he thought.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="23"><l n="a">And the brightness of the <foreign>aśoka,</foreign>*<foreign> asana </foreign>and <foreign>bāṇa</foreign> flowers paled in the reflected light along the river-banks.</l>
<l n="b">The charms of the honey trees* faded and dimmed as their flower buds* were swept away,*</l>
<l n="c">Thinking only of how delightful it would be, never losing hope* that they might be sought out as the flower-ornaments* of lovers happening by.</l>
<l n="d">At peace, now that the bees had abandoned them and no longer sipped their perfume, they waited to fall.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="24"><l n="a">In all its beauty, it was a perfect bower for lovers to worship at the shrine of the pleasures of love.</l>
<l n="b">There were <foreign>tañjung</foreign> flowers, poignantly casting the message of the hidden perfume of their petals on the wind,*</l>
<l n="c">Giving forth such delightful fragrance that the blossoming <foreign>śikhari</foreign> could do nothing but seek cover behind the <foreign>wungū.</foreign></l>
<l n="d">Moreover,* arching over, flowers unfurled, they stood ready to watch over those tormented by pangs of love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="25"><l n="a">Even as the sun began to set and the beauty of that place became dim and melancholy, still it was enchanting.</l>
<l n="b">It seemed a pity that no poet came wandering by on his journey, to tell of its charms on his writing board.</l>
<l n="c">When lo, a peacock appeared and stopped to rest there, for all the world like just such a wanderer in pursuit of beauty,</l>
<l n="d">So aptly storing in its poetic cries the delights of the Saraswatī River.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="26"><l n="a">With tranquil mind [Arjuna] lost himself in contemplation, as, preparing for what lay ahead,* he pondered thus:</l>
<l n="b">‘Successful are they who attain freedom from passion and think only of the ultimate goal of becoming a supreme sage.</l>
<l n="c">Yet because of the extent of the ten senses,* crushing the innermost recesses of the heart,* subjecting it to their will, </l>
<l n="d">Meditation on Śiwa is destroyed and annihilated and there is the risk that passion and darkness* will rise up.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="27"><l n="a">‘Only excellence of mind should be practised in order to reach the essence of existence.</l>
<l n="b">Clearly it is like the wheel of a chariot, which, if loosened, has no purpose at all.</l>
<l n="c">For the true nature of corporeal existence is nothing less than offering oneself up in sacrifice through excellent meritorious deeds.</l>
<l n="d">And so, clearly, in this life, the best course is to be willing to face the arduous task* of living virtuously.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="28"><l n="a">This was the essence of his reflections on mastering the injunctions of the holy seers.</l>
<l n="b">As if in confusion the heart, subject as it is to the ten senses, turns this way and that, in every direction, when meditating.</l>
<l n="c">Disunity of mind then allows troubles to enter and brings aversion to the innermost secrets of meditation.</l>
<l n="d">And so, soothed by the rumbling voice of the <foreign>kuwong</foreign>, he then fell silent<foreign>.</foreign></l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="2">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">In the late afternoon he set off again,</l>
<l n="b">With his heart firmly fixed on his goal of reaching the Himālaya mountains.</l>
<l n="c">And as his journey took him to the east, effortlessly, along a flat valley road,</l>
<l n="d">He was entranced at the sight of the birds, flying in formation, then vanishing from sight.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The faint fragrance of the forest flowers* wafting in the breeze, was delightful.</l>
<l n="b">His heart aflutter,* he hearkened to the buzzing of the bees.</l>
<l n="c">To him, their murmurs were the whisperings of those who know love for the first time,</l>
<l n="d">And the intermittent cries of the magnificent peacocks delighted him.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">From* clusters of forest flowers, fragrance spread like falling rain,</l>
<l n="b">As the gentle breeze hunted them out, enhancing their radiant beauty.</l>
<l n="c">Flowers lay scattered, some like fallen arrows,* others intertwined </l>
<l n="d">In the thickets of <foreign>luruk-luruk, </foreign>like flowers in a hair-knot.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">In the heat, the <foreign>suḍa,</foreign>* its creepers unfurling, wilted too, sad and downcast.</l>
<l n="b">A profusion of <foreign>katirah</foreign> hung down, its aerial shoots* throwing themselves to the ground,* moving to and fro imploringly.</l>
<l n="c"><foreign>Pakis haji </foreign>ferns shook and in frenzied longing hid themselves away,</l>
<l n="d">While <foreign>wĕlas-harĕp</foreign> creepers formed a concealing curtain for a lover’s retreat.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">The buds of the <foreign>mangunĕng</foreign> creeper* hung limply and seemed dull as the sun’s rays beat down on them.</l>
<l n="b">Weary, sighing plaintively, their supple boughs bending low without strength, they waited for the thunder.</l>
<l n="c">Huddled in their sheaths, the <foreign>gĕsing</foreign> bamboos rustled in the awesome grip of passion,</l>
<l n="d">Restive, as the <foreign>prabhu sanmata</foreign> enclosed them in its soft embrace.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The dense thickets were hidden from view* under a tangle of fearful creepers,</l>
<l n="b">That hung upside down, covering* the pendant <foreign>halikukun,</foreign> unfurling there.</l>
<l n="c">The <foreign>kayĕn</foreign> trees which rose up in the valleys, burst into blossom and held themselves in readiness.</l>
<l n="d">In the stillness, a <foreign>cĕb luput</foreign> bird opened wide its eyes, as a mouse scuttled by.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Let us pass over the time when the prince wound his way through the forest. </l>
<l n="b">Here he traversed a deep water-course, there ravines and rugged mountains, difficult of access,* </l>
<l n="c">But he was content as he sought his destination – the source of that river of flawless purity,</l>
<l n="d">And there, in a welcoming hermitage, he found shelter for the night.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Faithful to his [vow] of striving for detachment,* the prince again sought solitude,</l>
<l n="b">The wooded hills* his sole companions as he travelled on.</l>
<l n="c">And they, determined to receive him with joy as an honoured guest, offered their many fruits to him.</l>
<l n="d">While, nearby, a splendid waterfall readied itself to be his holy bathing place.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">He came at last to the Hima mountain, with its splendid settlements.</l>
<l n="b">It was as resplendent as the abode of the gods in the glow of the setting sun.</l>
<l n="c">White clouds enshrouded it like magnificent battlements,</l>
<l n="d">And it seemed to have exchanged its beauty* for that of the heavens.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="3">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The beautiful mountain scenery seemed to be in restless motion.</l>
<l n="b">As if calling to him, the casurinas rustled, tossing and turning in the wind.</l>
<l n="c">Waiting expectantly, the dancing branches* whispered,</l>
<l n="d">Their graceful, overhanging shoots ever reaching out to him.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">On the densely-forested slopes were gardens, </l>
<l n="b">All the more beautiful for they were shafted with bands* of golden sunlight.</l>
<l n="c">With infinite care, they had adorned themselves delightfully with flowers, their blossoms agleam, </l>
<l n="d">And seemed to have decorated themselves for joy that Arjuna, the son of Pāṇḍu, was visiting* there.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">On reflection, it seemed the forest had prepared a welcome for its guest:</l>
<l n="b">The gift it offered was the profusion of blossoming flowers so beautifully spread before him.</l>
<l n="c">With wavering fronds* and red petals, the flame trees,</l>
<l n="d">Like lips eagerly seeking pleasure, awaited him.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">With its many valleys, it was as grand and idyllic as the Nandana grove.*</l>
<l n="b">Its delightful caves, quite extraordinary in their perfection, were its ornaments.</l>
<l n="c">Among its trees of many kinds were the heavenly coral-trees,* fresh and blossoming,</l>
<l n="d">With a canopy of trailing,* leafy fronds unfurling.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">A river flowed delightfully into the crevices of the craggy peaks.</l>
<l n="b">Streams spouted from the rocks, forming a pond like a small sea.</l>
<l n="c">The rock face was of such brilliance that it challenged the beauty of the ocean,</l>
<l n="d">With scattered, flowering pandanus draped* everywhere over its lovely stones.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Pārtha’s heart was captivated as he climbed higher and higher up Mount Hima.</l>
<l n="b">He became ever more amazed as he gazed upon its celestial beauty.</l>
<l n="c">It towered over the realm of the Bhāratas,</l>
<l n="d">Looking down on the steep valleys of the eastern mountain with its one hundred holy bathing pools.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Over a ravine so deep and impenetrable* that it was lost to view, clouds gathered,</l>
<l n="b">To merge into its gleaming sulphur, caressing it, veiling it,</l>
<l n="c">Forming a bright shining halo of light,*</l>
<l n="d">Pregnant with the soft rain that is always betokened* by the voice of the thunder.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">A gleam of water marked the location of the spotless river.*</l>
<l n="b">Indeed here was the ‘Gateway of the Ganges’,* guarding the secret of its purity.</l>
<l n="c">‘I will go* there’, he thought, and set off, making his way down</l>
<l n="d">Along a narrow, rugged path, strewn with boulders, through the sharp and jagged ravines.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">So arduous was it, that it hardly seemed possible a mere mortal could penetrate its depths and reach the bottom,</l>
<l n="b">Unless he were a perfect sage or an excellent priest who had put aside worldly concerns.*</l>
<l n="c">Thus it was proof of the true excellence of this son of Pāṇḍu,</l>
<l n="d">That, engaged as he was in striving for the welfare of the world, he came there with ease.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">And so it was that Pārtha came there to that remote river,*</l>
<l n="b">And beheld the well-spring of the River Ganges, utterly flawless and without stain,</l>
<l n="c">Flowing from a fissure in its unfathomable depths, its eddying waters gushed forth,</l>
<l n="d">Like the emanation of the moon, giving life to all the world.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a"> 	On reaching it, the prince was filled with great peace,*</l>
<l n="b">As he gazed upon the clear water of the Ganges, the water of life,</l>
<l n="c">For indeed it was ever the means to assuage the despairing heart.</l>
<l n="d">Descending to the source* of holy water, he bathed in its waters and purified himself.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="4">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Thus Pārtha came to those sacred waters.*</l>
<l n="b">As he immersed himself in the waters of the source of that river, possessed of sanctifying power.</l>
<l n="c">Its full-flowing waters truly cleansed his mind, </l>
<l n="d">As he recited incantations and performed his devotions.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">He concentrated his mind on the immaterial presence of Śiwa,*</l>
<l n="b">Arising from the eight-petalled lotus, and firmly established* in the river.</l>
<l n="c">The essence of the sun* was invoked into the firmament,</l>
<l n="d">As, absorbed* in meditation, he became one in union with the sacred symbol.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">A beautiful woman appeared in the presence of the prince.</l>
<l n="b">Her perfection was such that she seemed to be the younger sister of Beauty itself, bringing love.</l>
<l n="c">She was indeed the month of spring, the embodiment of all that is lovely.</l>
<l n="d">Her sweetness held the longed-for charms of the moon.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Clearly she would arouse the bemused poet, wandering in pursuit of beauty, from his reverie.*</l>
<l n="b">Like the fall of a fine misty rain, her enchanting hair-knot diffused its fragrance.</l>
<l n="c">Her ear-rings shone all the while, revealing sudden flashes of lightning,</l>
<l n="d">And the glow of her shining face ever enhanced her radiance.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Pārtha had now finished his dawn worship,*</l>
<l n="b">And his heart seemed to stop as he saw her appear as if from nowhere.</l>
<l n="c">None other than the Goddess of the Hima mountain and the River Jāhnawī was she,</l>
<l n="d">And now he became more convinced that she was a vision.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">‘Where are you bound, little sister? gently he asked,</l>
<l n="b">‘In journeying to this mountain, where I travel on pilgrimage to the sacred waters,</l>
<l n="c">I had not thought it would also be the destination of those who wish to abandon themselves to the pursuit of Beauty.</l>
<l n="d">Yet you are a jewel, Beauty itself, my wondrous one.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a"> 	‘How foolish I am, making bold to presume that you could only be properly*</l>
<l n="b">Depicted as the riches of a garden offering its beauty:</l>
<l n="c">Your teeth gleam with the allure of <foreign>śrīdanta</foreign> flowers,</l>
<l n="d">And [red] <foreign>handul</foreign> flowers are always as one with your gums.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">‘The striking beauty of the <foreign>katirah</foreign> flower finds refuge in your lips,</l>
<l n="b">And in your eyes rests the dark beauty of the blue lotus.</l>
<l n="c">In your neck is the slenderness of the fresh <foreign>jangga</foreign> vine, its shoots unfurling,</l>
<l n="d">And I cannot but think, my lady, that the <foreign>mangunĕng</foreign> has taken on the form of your lovely hair-band.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">‘Your slender body is a blossoming <foreign>priyaka.</foreign> </l>
<l n="b">Your arms put to shame the tendrils of the delightful <foreign>aśoka,</foreign></l>
<l n="c">Your calves disturb the fragrant pandanus,</l>
<l n="d">While your full breasts imitate* the rounded, ivory coconuts.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">Thus did Pārtha sing her praises with sweet words.</l>
<l n="b">Understanding his allusion, the maiden said:</l>
<l n="c">‘O my Lord! Your perfection* indeed exceeds that of mortal men.</l>
<l n="d">For you have come here to this place, where I have never before seen a soul.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">‘Your mighty deed is great, even incomparable, </l>
<l n="b">You have succeeded in penetrating the inaccessible Hima mountain.</l>
<l n="c">It is the highest degree of excellence, and </l>
<l n="d">You are fitting to be the refuge of those who seek the prosperity of the world.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">Thus she said, soothingly addressing kind and friendly words to him.</l>
<l n="b">And Phalguṇa, with gentle words respectfully replied:</l>
<l n="c">‘Dear maiden, who are you, O beautiful one, who comes here?</l>
<l n="d">Tell me truthfully, great is my concern [for you]!</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">‘Dear maiden, are you, little sister, a goddess in immaterial form?</l>
<l n="b">Because all that is charming waits upon you,</l>
<l n="c">The flowers all seek refuge with you.*</l>
<l n="d">Clearly they lie in wait here to scratch you, that you might see how they long to attend upon you.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">‘Truly the incarnation of the entrancing beauty of the fourth month, are you,</l>
<l n="b">The ethereal deity of the sea of honey in bodily form.</l>
<l n="c">It is as if to seek to express the marvels of the ocean in poetry</l>
<l n="d">Or to ascribe beauty to the mountains, would cause confusion.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15"><l n="a">‘Further, my dear, is it not fruitless for you to stay so pitifully </l>
<l n="b">In this inaccessible, remote place, all alone?</l>
<l n="c">Though you seem undaunted, are you not fearful to stay in these wooded hills,</l>
<l n="d">Where lions, elephants, snakes and tigers lie in wait?’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="16"><l n="a">In this way the prince questioned her closely.</l>
<l n="b">The one addressed so sweetly, answered him truthfully:</l>
<l n="c">‘My lord, listen to me, your servant,</l>
<l n="d">I am a woman, called Ulupuy, beset by love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="17"><l n="a">‘I will tell you why I have taken on the form of a woman.</l>
<l n="b">There is a king, His Majesty, Korawya, a renowned and illustrious mighty serpent,</l>
<l n="c">Who alone is so awesome in his power</l>
<l n="d">That his irresistible valour is without equal in the three worlds.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="18"><l n="a">‘His kingdom too is of extraordinary, outstanding splendour</l>
<l n="b">Because of the lustre of its countless gems and jewels.</l>
<l n="c">Like Indra’s heaven, its beauty is without flaw,</l>
<l n="d">And by dint of its very nature, <foreign>parijāta</foreign> and <foreign>kalpawṛkṣa</foreign> trees grow there.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="19"><l n="a">‘Moreover, even heaven is inferior to it, its beauty rivalled</l>
<l n="b">By the unique fashioning of the underworld.*</l>
<l n="c">Truly, it is a creation of Lord Brahma himself,</l>
<l n="d">Unparalleled, for he has given his full attention to its creation.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="20"><l n="a">‘This then is where the foremost king of the snakes dwells in contentment.</l>
<l n="b">All vassal snakes are loyal to him,</l>
<l n="c">And as for me, I am the daughter of the snake king,</l>
<l n="d">And from time immemorial, I have never known the least sorrow.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="5">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">‘My father has so lavished upon me the quintessence of supreme happiness,</l>
<l n="b">That I found myself unable to take any pleasure in anything, so sated* was I by such infinite bliss.</l>
<l n="c">I could not resist searching out the peace of this lonely, secluded place,</l>
<l n="d">But upon reaching here, suddenly I came upon you, seeking union with the god in the River Jāhnawī.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">‘And thus I was smitten by violent passions, wounded by Smara’s fiery arrow.</l>
<l n="b">It is only by tasting* the flow of your sweetness that my desire and longing can find respite.</l>
<l n="c">For the goddess Ratih, Goddess of Love, has so enflamed the feelings of this yearning, lovesick woman,</l>
<l n="d">Who hopes for the excellent ambrosia of your love, for you are the embodiment of the God of Love himself.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">‘Moreover, could it possibly be fitting for you to live in the forest, staying in the undergrowth in such a pitiable condition,</l>
<l n="b">Eager to conceal yourself, seeking shelter under overhanging rocks, emaciated, unkempt and lack-lustre?</l>
<l n="c">How can you find enjoyment, resting on a bed of dry, withered, fallen leaves?</l>
<l n="d">Words cannot describe how your body has wasted away, and has lost its strength and become wrinkled from long contact* with them.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">‘In short, my lord, please come with me now to the kingdom of the serpent king and seek </l>
<l n="b">To enjoy the happiness that my great devotion will afford you. I beg of you, please accept my offer.</l>
<l n="c">There is no doubt you will be accorded the devotion of all the snakes. Their only wish will be to serve you</l>
<l n="d">With food and refreshments, caring for your every wish, joining with you in sexual union.’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Thus implored Ulupuy, overcome by passion. Pārtha answered lovingly and sweetly:</l>
<l n="b">‘O most excellent jewel among women! My dear! By stealth you have captivated my very heart.</l>
<l n="c">Alas, though, the charm of your seductive words cuts me to the quick, cruelly breaking my heart into little pieces,</l>
<l n="d">My dear, I must ask you to accept that I must refuse your love, O little sister.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">‘For I am now bound by the agreement that Nārada has ordained,</l>
<l n="b">To live as a <foreign>brāhmācārya</foreign>, holding to chastity. That is the reason I wander here in the Himālaya, seeking solitude.</l>
<l n="c">Only after twelve years will it end and I must wait until that time has elapsed.</l>
<l n="d">But how it casts me down, now that I, too, am filled with the desire to enjoy sexual union anew.’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Thus Arjuna gave her answer, and again the girl spoke:</l>
<l n="b">‘O my lord, you are mistaken in taking so much to heart the words of the seer.</l>
<l n="c">I understand what he meant in urging you to comply with his instruction.</l>
<l n="d">But surely your solemn and abiding vow was intended only to apply to the Lady Dropadī?</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">‘With another, how could it be wrong for you to devote yourself to love-making?</l>
<l n="b">It would not be adultery if you were to accept my words that speak of seeking sensual pleasure.*</l>
<l n="c">The purpose of assiduously performing the yoga of love is the prosperity of your lineage,</l>
<l n="d">So that in practising it and becoming steadfastly absorbed in it, you may achieve the Absolute.’*</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="6">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">How could the prince do other than accept her words, seeking to woo him?</l>
<l n="b">He tried to curb his doubts then, for her words, asking to be accepted, rang true.</l>
<l n="c">And so he sanctioned* them, receiving them favourably, for they were so meet.</l>
<l n="d">Moreover, their sweetness was without flaw. ‘No harm* can come of this’, he thought.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">And so he decided to follow his desires,* as is the nature of hearts that share love.</l>
<l n="b">The prince stood up, made ready, and followed the snake girl.</l>
<l n="c">Through a split in the earth’s surface, they took the road to the underworld.</l>
<l n="d">But even as they walked on together, without stopping to rest, he took pleasure in the features of the path that she pointed out to him.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">They came to her home, a place* where the buildings were of incomparable splendour.</l>
<l n="b">The houses were made of gold and all the gateways and fences were of gold and jewels.</l>
<l n="c">With its adornments radiating a shimmering glow, it looked like an orb of light, </l>
<l n="d">And its dazzling beauty seemed to emanate* from heaven.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The world of the gods is made radiant by the sun, that most excellent of brilliant jewels.</l>
<l n="b">It is impossible* for it to grow dim there, even when daylight passes and night falls.</l>
<l n="c">As for the underworld, when night comes there, the darkness is diminished,</l>
<l n="d">For there is constant light from the ever-gleaming crystal and jewels.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">The snake girl led the prince within,</l>
<l n="b">And presented to him the beauty of the place: its golden encircling walls* were indeed perfect.</l>
<l n="c">Beautiful women sat there, like scattered jewels loosened from a string. Sweet were their charms,</l>
<l n="d">Their side-ways glances arousing desire, their supple bodies the very embodiment of young boughs.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">There were some who drew near, ready to receive him, eager to provide all that is due to a guest,</l>
<l n="b">Sweetly displaying the fire of their natures in their subtle gestures.*</l>
<l n="c">Delightfully bespattered with a dusting of flower-pollen, fragrantly perfumed with musk,</l>
<l n="d">Their loveliness was enough to render him speechless, as they seemed to offer their sweetness to his gaze.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">There was a pavilion of crystal, its roof a <foreign>madana-</foreign>lotus* of chased gold,</l>
<l n="b">With a wonderful arrangement of flower-shaped adornments, formed of brilliant jewels.</l>
<l n="c">There was, as well, a couch awaiting there, the visible manifestation of a hymn to love.*</l>
<l n="d">Its painted cloths were decorated with clusters of rays, so that it seemed to be the moon’s secret hide-away.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">And so the beautiful girl and the prince mounted the curtained bedstead.</l>
<l n="b">Under the ineluctable force of their love, they found harmony at once, their feelings as one.</l>
<l n="c">Their union there on that lovely couch was full of joy, the essence of sweet delight,</l>
<l n="d">And they seemed the incarnation of the beautiful jasmine, intertwined with the <foreign>gaḍung.</foreign></l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Or their union was perhaps that of flower buds seeking to draw near to the beauty of the river.</l>
<l n="b">Clearly the two on the couch were Ratih and Manasija, goddess and god of Love.</l>
<l n="c">The entwining of their souls* in sexual congress formed a temple for the innermost expression of the art of love.*</l>
<l n="d">Suddenly they could no longer resist tasting the welcome delights* of love-making.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">Later, when they had been united together in the raptures of love there on the bed,</l>
<l n="b">Their sudden delight knew no bounds, their very hearts were touched in their new-found mastery.*</l>
<l n="c">Together they came out and sat side by side outside the pavilion,</l>
<l n="d">Where their waiting retinue approached them to wait upon them and offer them all that had been prepared.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">As they sat outside the crystal pavilion it was as if they had descended from Smara’s heaven.</l>
<l n="b">Again and again they partook of the many delicacies of exquisite flavour that stood ready.</l>
<l n="c">After they had eaten they again withdrew and together climbed onto the couch,</l>
<l n="d">Tirelessly seeking union there on the bed, never wearying of love-making.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">Blissfully, these enamoured lovers dallied together there on the couch.</l>
<l n="b">Then, they wandered together out into the garden, wanting to be alone.</l>
<l n="c">Inseparable, they again sought bliss there in the moonlight,</l>
<l n="d">Even resting together on a bed of flowers and leaves.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">The joyful harbinger of the fourth month, the thunder, brought the promise of soft rain.</l>
<l n="b">They wandered here and there, happily stopping from time to time at a hermitage.</l>
<l n="c">Moreover on the bank of the river that descended into the ravines near the most inaccessible gullies,</l>
<l n="d">There was a spring where they disported together, constant companions, taking with them as provisions only their love and desire.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">For a long time they lived together in love, delighting in their passion and love-making,</l>
<l n="b">Adept at devoting* themselves to love, ever-willing to surrender to pleasure,</l>
<l n="c">Joyfully tasting* the doctrine of love perfected by Dhanañjaya,</l>
<l n="d">Striving after union with the deity of love in immaterial form, abandoning themselves to the delights of bliss.*</l>

<l n="d">Through the many hills and valleys.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="8">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">He reached a wondrous, rugged mountain range of unearthly beauty,</l>
<l n="b">The renowned Nilaśṛngga.* The thick undergrowth of its foothills was difficult to traverse.</l>
<l n="c">Its winding gullies were deep, its peak towered over the ravines.</l>
<l n="d">Rushing streams welled up from their source and plummeted down into the valleys.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Pure mountain brooks whirled and gushed* from the crevices in the hills,</l>
<l n="b">Shining silver-bright, for all the world like the milk of the earth.</l>
<l n="c">Merrily a dove bathed and fluttered its wings, sporting and playing in the water,*</l>
<l n="d">Accompanied by its entire family, all of whom had joined in this visit to the holy bathing pool of the seers.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The beauty spots towering high above were a delight to see.</l>
<l n="b">On the hillsides, hermitages nestled at the edges of the ravines.</l>
<l n="c">Dotted here and there, in delightful clusters,</l>
<l n="d">Were <foreign>puṣpadeha*</foreign> trees, all aflame, like carefully tended fires* that are never allowed to go out.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Enchanting was the sight of all the accomplished, charming anchoresses.</l>
<l n="b">The sweetness they presented to his gaze, as he beheld them, was that of <foreign>campaka</foreign> flowers.</l>
<l n="c">With veiled looks,* as is only to be expected, they threatened him with their quivering eyebrows,</l>
<l n="d">But their sidelong glances, with hidden smiles, were as sweet as syrup.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">There, in the outer gardens, they gaily gathered vegetables and mushrooms,</l>
<l n="b">As well as <foreign>lalab</foreign>,* which they wrapped in their breast cloths, with never a thought to their [bare] breasts.</l>
<l n="c">Their sweet chorus, rising up faintly as they sang there on the side of the ravines, was a joy,</l>
<l n="d">As the frogs answered in soft counterpoint from the gullies.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">In the forest hermitage, love-smitten, they offered their beauty to the seers.*</l>
<l n="b">Some gathered flowers and bunches of grass which they then arranged, carefully protecting them from their [sharp] nails;</l>
<l n="c">Others walked carefully, gracefully into the pond to scoop up water,</l>
<l n="d">And as he watched them closely and they feigned displeasure, they seemed just as sweet as heavenly nymphs.</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">From above, the water [of the pond] lapped at the waters of the sea lying below.</l>
<l n="b">A fountain spouted up from a fissure, its water thrown up in the centre.</l>
<l n="c">The misty, glistening spray, lit by the sun’s rays, formed a rainbow,</l>
<l n="d">With jets of water that looked like a line of slithering snakes flying through the air.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">The buds of the woodland trees sighed with longing for the fine river mist.</l>
<l n="b">And seemed to draw near its beauty humbly, to ask that they might be placed in a hair-knot.</l>
<l n="c">As Dhanañjaya came without warning on the delights of the hermitage,</l>
<l n="d">The sound of the <foreign>kuwong</foreign> seemed to call them to come forward now that the prince had arrived.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="9">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Completely absorbed, the noble Phalguṇa gazed with delight upon</l>
<l n="b">The scenic beauty of that mountain hermitage as it rose into view,</l>
<l n="c">And because he felt so weary, now that the sun’s heat had utterly sapped his strength,</l>
<l n="d">In the end he did not hurry past at all, so tired was he.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">At times the path climbed upwards and he could look with delight, as far as the horizon.</l>
<l n="b">The beauty was enhanced by the lovely birds on their homeward journey.</l>
<l n="c">Gracefully flying in formation, they faded from sight,</l>
<l n="d">While with breathtaking beauty, the hills seemed to flash.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The delightful path went step-by-step downwards along the side of the deep ravine.</l>
<l n="b">The undergrowth came right* to the ledge, hidden* beneath the overhanging creepers.</l>
<l n="c">By leaning over a long way, he could see the shoots of the <foreign>galing</foreign> creeper* far down in the gully,</l>
<l n="d">Some were entwined around the betel trees, others stood tall and straight.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The new leaves of the <foreign>walik-aḍĕp</foreign> on the outskirts of the hermitage, flickered.</l>
<l n="b">Wild banana leaves hung limply as if deprived of strength,</l>
<l n="c">Then, as the wind caught them, stood straight out like pennants,*</l>
<l n="d">Alternating with the fluttering shoots of the <foreign>anḍuru</foreign>* beckoning constantly.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Just then, the clear cry of the barking deer rang out. How sweet its gaze*</l>
<l n="b">As it came to rest on the merry monkeys bustling about in the trees.</l>
<l n="c">Some were lazily nibbling the many fruits, chattering the while.</l>
<l n="d">Others, the long-tailed monkeys, rested, just squatting in the branches, oblivious to everything.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">It would take too long to describe* this scene. Soon after, he came to a hermitage.</l>
<l n="b">The trees all shimmered as if to welcome him.</l>
<l n="c">Coquettishly they let their flowers fall to the ground like a rain of jewels,</l>
<l n="d">Releasing their fragrant perfume without pause as they lay scattered there, enchantingly.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Time passed and in the quiet of evening the sun took its course.*</l>
<l n="b">Its rays lost their splendour as dusk fell.</l>
<l n="c">As if dyed crimson-red, the heavens shone brightly,</l>
<l n="d">Wisps of cloud spattered here and there like drops of blood.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">The magnificent design of that sacred hermitage enhanced the beauty even more.</l>
<l n="b">It was shrouded in webs of cloud that settled over all,</l>
<l n="c">And were absorbed* into the smoke of the sacrificial fires of the seers,</l>
<l n="d">In evidence that impurity and darkness of mind had been destroyed, burnt up in the fire.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">The fragrance of the oblations within wafted out and spread far and wide.</l>
<l n="b">Their perfumes, mingling together with the scent of aromatic smoke from the lamps, covered everything.</l>
<l n="c">Cymbals clashed, bells tinkled together in unison</l>
<l n="d">With the recitation of prayers - all served to captivate his heart and bring him peace.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">Birds billed and cooed all the while as they roosted in the hermitage,</l>
<l n="b">In tumultuous discourse, ever discussing and interpreting the sacred syllables,</l>
<l n="c">To the delightful accompaniment of the bees whose voices could be heard in the fragrant garlands,*</l>
<l n="d">As if expert in gracefully leading the gentle, mellifluous singing.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">So many delights did the prince see in the hermitage,</l>
<l n="b">And so astonished and enraptured was he, that his weariness vanished.</l>
<l n="c">Lost in thought, he observed closely, resting on a flat, broad rock</l>
<l n="d">And determined, instead, to spend the night in the hermitage.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="10">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">But let us now turn our attention to the seers who all came quickly to welcome their guest.</l>
<l n="b">All the anchoresses who dwelt in the hermitage and who had been dressing themselves came forth,</l>
<l n="c">Rushing out, leaving behind their clothing of bark cloth, unable to wait.</l>
<l n="d">So full of joy were they to see a man of such beauty that they were quite overwhelmed.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">They ran toward the prince who, as if summoned by the power of their meditation,* sat there</l>
<l n="b">Charmingly, underneath an <foreign>aśoka</foreign> tree, holding on his lap a garland of flowers.</l>
<l n="c">The ascetics gazed at him open-mouthed,* for his appearance so far surpassed all others in excellence,</l>
<l n="d">That they could only think that he was the God of Love Kāma, the sight of him rendering them speechless.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The nuns too were so dazed that they seemed to have lost their senses,</l>
<l n="b">Displaying their thoughts and longings as if they were quite incapable of hiding the desire in their eyes.</l>
<l n="c">The seers greeted him: ‘Fortunate are we who dwell in this hermitage!</l>
<l n="d">By your arrival, O Prince, we have now reaped the rewards of those* who have achieved indifference to the world.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">‘What is it you seek in wandering these forested regions, O Prince?</l>
<l n="b">It is as if you are the origin* of all that is excellent, and will bring to an end the barren state of us who dwell in this forest.</l>
<l n="c">Through steadfast meditation, the felicity of our ascetic practices has been restored,</l>
<l n="d">And now, by your kind favour, we will go on to attain our goals.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Thus said the great sages and the prince told the holy men,</l>
<l n="b">Serenely, of the true reason he had come to the holy bathing place,</l>
<l n="c">Relating also the tale of his deeds in the underworld.</l>
<l n="d">Happy were the seers to hear [his story] which so heartened them.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">At last, the ascetics escorted the prince into the hermitage.</l>
<l n="b">On his arrival they treated him with great care and attention,</l>
<l n="c">Providing him with water for washing his face and feet, as well as roots, fruits and efficacious herbs and potions.</l>
<l n="d">Dhanañjaya was delighted, his heart captivated by the seers.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">During the time the prince spent in the hermitage,</l>
<l n="b">Many ascetics came to him,* longing to draw near him.</l>
<l n="c">He wandered in the hermitage and was welcomed wherever he went by great sages,</l>
<l n="d">Bringing joy to the holy men of these communities.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">For a long time he sojourned with the seers,</l>
<l n="b">As if he had no other thought in his mind* but the constant well-being of others.</l>
<l n="c">At last he begged leave to depart from the holy abbot,</l>
<l n="d">Who, pleased to consent, embraced the prince:</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">‘O Sir, place of refuge of the defenceless, who cares for the welfare of religious communities throughout the kingdom!</l>
<l n="b">We have been able to share in the joy of one such as you, who is endowed with true excellence, my lord.</l>
<l n="c">Clearly, you are a great man in choosing to dwell in the mountains.</l>
<l n="d">May you show compassion and continue to travel the path of virtue* as the support of righteousness!’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">Thus said the priestly sage. The prince then set off,</l>
<l n="b">Making his way through the groves of the hermitage towards the rolling hills.</l>
<l n="c">Devoted as he was to spiritual purity, he bathed there in the river and was cleansed of all impurities.</l>
<l n="d">He then set off for another realm, where too he was received with joy.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">For there was a most excellent king, famed throughout the land for his meritorious deeds and exceptional qualities,</l>
<l n="b">Who reigned in Mayūra, the marvellous capital of his kingdom.</l>
<l n="c">The name of Citradahana was truly renowned as world-protector,</l>
<l n="d">He was ever the benefactor of those without recourse, never seeking victory when he saw others fail.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="11">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">King Citradahana had a daughter of such flawless beauty,</l>
<l n="b">It seemed the Goddess of Beauty had taken residence in her body.</l>
<l n="c">The very perfume of the flowers seemed diminished as they held their breath in awe of her, </l>
<l n="d">And therefore the princess was known as Citragandhā, ‘The Fragrant One.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">But it was well-known that the king’s mind was indeed troubled, </l>
<l n="b">His heart dwelled only on his plight.</l>
<l n="c">For he knew there was a danger he would have no one to succeed him in the future,</l>
<l n="d">And was full of concern for the protection of his realm.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The king thought constantly of his coming need for a son-in-law,</l>
<l n="b">And thus he sought a perfect man of good character,</l>
<l n="c">That he might beget an heir who would succeed to the throne and rule the land,</l>
<l n="d">But his heart knew only despair as he reflected on his desire.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">For what worthy man would really allow such a thing,</l>
<l n="b">And be willing to marry without force or command?*</l>
<l n="c">‘To act in such a way would certainly be wrong’, he thought, ‘truly base conduct.</l>
<l n="d">It is not the proper way of upright men to embark on an evil course.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">‘For girls ripe for marriage, it should be like this:</l>
<l n="b">A flower at the peak of beauty attracts the bee itself </l>
<l n="c">And so it is fitting that she should be carried off by force to find satisfaction.</l>
<l n="d">Such is the analogy for young people who obtain their partners without coercion.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Thus the king grieved, with nothing to solace his heart,</l>
<l n="b">He forgot everything but his fervent longing, finding it impossible to conquer* his wandering thoughts.</l>
<l n="c">His advisors too, seemed helpless,</l>
<l n="d">‘Such has never happened before’ they thought, every one of them moaning with distress.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">But in the web of existence, two forces ebb and flow -</l>
<l n="b">Good and evil - both are encountered, both are ever-present,</l>
<l n="c">In equal measure, always part of the life of every creature.</l>
<l n="d">Rich and poor, coarse and fine, there is none who is not held in their thrall.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Those who forget the meaning of religion and neglect the eternal worship of Śiwa,</l>
<l n="b">Surely will encounter difficulties in their life and will never reach liberation.</l>
<l n="c">But the King of Mayūra was faithful in his religious observances and always adhered firmly to them.</l>
<l n="d">He, who had known joy, now found it was sorrow that drew near and trailed him.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">So he hid in his heart the great burden of his sorrow,</l>
<l n="b">And always allowed himself to be amused and seemingly untroubled.</l>
<l n="c">He diverted himself on the shore and in forest hermitages,</l>
<l n="d">Again and again, as a means of distracting himself from his misery.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">For a long time, the king had been in torment, filled with longing,</l>
<l n="b">Guided by the dictates of his heart, thinking only of the resolution of his dilemma,</l>
<l n="c">And now the intervention of the gods had brought about the arrival of Pārtha,</l>
<l n="d">Who would clearly dispel the king’s misery.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">For the beauty of the most excellent princess was so renowned</l>
<l n="b">That even the loveliness of the mountains trembled, their power to entrance vanquished.</l>
<l n="c">The charm of poems seemed to peter out, their beauty just floating away,</l>
<l n="d">And so, borne along by what he had heard, the prince came there.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">It was heard far and wide that Arjuna, the excellent son of Pāṇḍu, was visiting the king.</l>
<l n="b">How delighted he was to welcome this guest.</l>
<l n="c">His officials dared to place all their hopes in him,</l>
<l n="d">Like flower buds taking sustenance* from the arrival of the gentle rain from the clouds.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">All at once the country resembled a mighty ocean.</l>
<l n="b">It shook with the thundering of the people as they poured forth from the palace.</l>
<l n="c">The prince was like the full moon shining down upon them</l>
<l n="d">And so, beset by love-pangs, they whispered to each other, sighing continually.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">They stared and stared at the extraordinary beauty of the prince.</l>
<l n="b">He encompassed the arrival of the God of Love, the season of flowers and the sweetness of the season of honey at once.</l>
<l n="c">Moreover he was irresistible, mighty, splendid and virtuous in battle.</l>
<l n="d">And thus all they could talk of was this handsome prince.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15"><l n="a">And so, the king approached the prince,</l>
<l n="b">His countenance sweet with welcome, his every gesture friendly.</l>
<l n="c">His kind and warm greeting went straight to the heart of the newly-arrived guest:</l>
<l n="d">‘Great is our good fortune that you have come here, my son.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="16"><l n="a">‘We were like withered grass and trees that have given up hope, </l>
<l n="b">Denied access to rain, terrible indeed was our longing, weary were we with craving,</l>
<l n="c">Our restlessness plumbing the very depths. But now, suddenly, inexplicably, we have burst into bud.</l>
<l n="d">For we think, you have brought the mercy of god Suranatha within our reach.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="17"><l n="a">‘This realm has been so arid and fruitless,</l>
<l n="b">As if through its own misdeeds it has become barren and lustreless.</l>
<l n="c">It may now come to know good fortune,</l>
<l n="d">For your virtue and excellence will bring it prosperity.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="18"><l n="a">These were the king’s happy words. The prince replied:</l>
<l n="b">‘Indeed no, O King! You go too far in praising me thus.</l>
<l n="c">Your wisdom is all-surpassing. You are pure, concerned for the good of others, your power is over-reaching.</l>
<l n="d">And therefore, Your Majesty, I pay homage to you, you who makes my heart soar.’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="19"><l n="a">And he then asked for the hand of the excellent princess.</l>
<l n="b">The king of Mayūra was willing to grant his request:</l>
<l n="c">‘My dear boy, take my beloved daughter to serve you as your wife. You may be her husband.</l>
<l n="d">May you know joy! But there is a promise I must exact from you.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="20"><l n="a">‘Formerly Mayūra was an excellent realm, as you have no doubt heard.</l>
<l n="b">Its king, my own forefather, was Prabhākara.</l>
<l n="c">For a very long time he reigned,* but had no royal heir,</l>
<l n="d">And so, desirous of a child, he withdrew to perform austerities.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="21"><l n="a">‘When he saw how steadfast was the king, God Iśwara was merciful, </l>
<l n="b">And granted to him the boon of a child, </l>
<l n="c">And one, - and only one, - to each of his descendants too, </l>
<l n="d">So that, ever after, his line would reign in this kingdom.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="12">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">‘The cause of the difficulties we now suffer and which bring us such sorrow,</l>
<l n="b">Is that the deeds of his former life have come to nothing and have brought only bewilderment,</l>
<l n="c">For I am left with a child, a most beautiful daughter,</l>
<l n="d">Who obviously cannot continue to safeguard the weal of my subjects.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">‘Look kindly on my plea, O Prince. From you I hope for compassion.</l>
<l n="b">My request is for a male child,</l>
<l n="c">A child whose destiny it would be to be my heir,</l>
<l n="d">And be enthroned in this land. This is the bride-price.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Thus he spoke. The prince, without hesitation,</l>
<l n="b">Vowed that any child of the princess, </l>
<l n="c">Any fine son, would succeed to the throne.</l>
<l n="d">With this pledge, the agreement they had deliberated was sealed.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The king then gave directions* to all the palace officials,</l>
<l n="b">For the betrothal of the princess to Arjuna.</l>
<l n="c">The army were delighted to hear of it, giving their full support,</l>
<l n="d">For it is in the nature of those who serve to be loyal in this way.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">At once, they attended to all that would be required for the celebration of love.</l>
<l n="b">Preparing everything, bringing it all to the bed-chamber.</l>
<l n="c">Laying out for them perfectly, without delay,</l>
<l n="d">All the ritual requisites, of unequalled splendour, arranged in full measure.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The ladies of the palace, hearing [the news], took pleasure</l>
<l n="b">In preparing and setting out the gifts of homage attractively.</l>
<l n="c">Others attended to the ornaments but all were equally delighted to welcome their guest,</l>
<l n="d">Their hearts beating wildly with pleasure* as they pictured him in their minds.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">A beautiful pavilion* had been set ready for his use.</l>
<l n="b">It was unequalled in its true magnificence,</l>
<l n="c">Of unparalleled design, ringed by a moat,</l>
<l n="d">As splendid as the Hima mountain.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">This was the place they had prepared for Dhanañjaya.</l>
<l n="b">Many delicious dishes were to be made and offered to him.</l>
<l n="c">Ready to meet his every wish, some led the singing,</l>
<l n="d">Accompanying their melody with drums and the sweet music of the <foreign>kĕtur</foreign>.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">As the sun set, the king withdrew,</l>
<l n="b">His heart no longer beset by constant worry.</l>
<l n="c">Because of the strength of his feelings towards Dhanañjaya,</l>
<l n="d">His joy was reflected in his radiant countenance.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="13">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The king went to his quarters and made for the queen’s apartment within,</l>
<l n="b">Where his arrival was welcomed with smiles and he was ushered in with sweet glances.</l>
<l n="c">He informed the queen of what he had done </l>
<l n="d">And the reason for his plan to marry off their daughter.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The queen made no objection to the marriage of the princess.</l>
<l n="b">The palace ladies were also all highly delighted, some even felt burgeoning desire,</l>
<l n="c">Thinking: ‘Indeed the prince is fitting to hold power over our princess.’</l>
<l n="d">But let us not describe that. The king then went to the princess.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">As soon as she knew of the king’s visit, the princess</l>
<l n="b">Became very agitated, anxious to hear what he had in mind.</l>
<l n="c">The king’s approach filled her with an anxiety that she tried to restrain,</l>
<l n="d">Fighting back her tears, even as she came forward to greet him as he entered.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Her sorrow, so obviously hidden, filled the hearts of the palace women with pity.</l>
<l n="b">Many of her young attendants were skilful at interpreting the outward signs of her inner feelings</l>
<l n="c">And so they drew near to sit beside her, like a profusion of jasmine flowers to behold,</l>
<l n="d">But the princess so outstripped their charms, that even at first sight* she seemed like the moon.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">As she made her obeisance, her slender arms were like bending boughs.</l>
<l n="b">Her waist and limbs were so supple that they seemed a collection of unsharpened <foreign>kris.</foreign>*</l>
<l n="c">Even more beautiful was the sight of her body, aglow* in the light of the lamps.</l>
<l n="d">Her face grew pale like the waning moon, as she was suddenly overcome with fear.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Then the king, his queen beside him,* addressed the princess:</l>
<l n="b">‘O my child, there is none but you to whom we can turn to perform this favour for us.</l>
<l n="c">You alone can fulfil it and ensure our well-being, O princess,</l>
<l n="d">If only you will show compassion and be the instrument through which we may reach heaven.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">‘O my darling jewel, truly* we ask much of you.</l>
<l n="b">Please accept the inevitability of our words. How could we possibly deny* the love we have for you, my daughter?</l>
<l n="c">But now your body is ripe, the proper place to bring* a husband without delay,</l>
<l n="d">And so Dhanañjaya is to be your husband, for he is a fitting match for you’.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Thus said the king. As for the princess, she made no reply.</l>
<l n="b">Despairingly she held back her tears, her heart crushed, not knowing what to do.</l>
<l n="c">She feared to disappoint the king by disobeying his command,</l>
<l n="d">So she merely sighed endlessly as she listened to her father and mother.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">The queen spoke next: ‘My child you must heed the king,</l>
<l n="b">As you know we have only you, my dear, to uphold our honour.</l>
<l n="c">You will perform a great service for our lineage, if you but give life to a male grandchild,* </l>
<l n="d">Who will reign here in Mayūra, and thus your marriage settlement* will become the source of our kingdom’s strength.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">‘Come! Accept this! Do not suppose that the king would neglect his duty as ruler.</l>
<l n="b">He who has a child or wife wishes only to dispel their troubles.</l>
<l n="c">Unwise is he who is bound by the love of a child, for it will lead him to shame.</l>
<l n="d">His concern is that they are not held subject* by the fortunes and misfortunes that are encountered in this world.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">Having spoken thus the king [and queen] retired and the princess was left alone.</l>
<l n="b">So distraught was she as her maids led her away, that she felt suddenly faint, and swayed, burdened by sorrow.</l>
<l n="c">She reached the sanctuary of the bower of creepers, bewailing the fate of maidens* who are to wed.</l>
<l n="d">Her tears flowed unabated, as her maids tried to soothe her with words of comfort.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="14">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">All the ladies of the court were dazed and wandered restlessly about, lost in dreams, becoming weak with longing,</l>
<l n="b">Carried away by desire, overwhelmed with rapture, rendered powerless by the prince’s sweet charms that so wounded them.</l>
<l n="c">Feverish, burning with secret desires, overcome with the confusion of unfulfilled love, there in the moonlight that streamed in,</l>
<l n="d">Falling silent now he, who was the very embodiment of love, had come there riding upon the moon.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">One girl, sitting there forlornly on the floor with her hair unbound, swooning, was pitiful in her dejection,</l>
<l n="b">Writing of her desire on a lovely <foreign>sumanasa</foreign> flower, turning her longing to letters,</l>
<l n="c">As she whispered to her serving girl, telling of the pain of her love-sickness,</l>
<l n="d">Heart-brokenly giving voice to her sorrow in a charming lament.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Another, her <foreign>kain</foreign> in disarray,* lay on the lap of her attendant, her great ardour unabated,</l>
<l n="b">Confused, mad with longing for a response to the rapturous delight of blissful lovers,</l>
<l n="c">Who are happy just to wander along the sea-shore, lost in the composition of love-poems,</l>
<l n="d">Undaunted even when brought to a stop by the rising tide, content, though there is no shelter for the night.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Yet another jewel among women, her charms at their peak like a flower in bud,</l>
<l n="b">Mournfully lost in reverie, weighed down by her feelings of longing and sadness, was being gently massaged, underneath an <foreign>aśoka</foreign> tree.</l>
<l n="c">Her maid, assiduously devoted to her every need, attended her with words of comfort,</l>
<l n="d">But knew full well that only in union with the prince could she find comfort for her sorrow:</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">‘How can a profusion of flower-buds* burst open, if they must risk spoiling their beauty?</l>
<l n="b">They will wither completely if the fourth month does not come to bring its gentle rain, so that they might unfold.</l>
<l n="c">Their new leaves are to no avail, the spiteful wind seems only to tease them mercilessly, tossing them to and fro,</l>
<l n="d">So that they want only to dive into those cruel clouds so long awaited, bowed down with longing.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">‘Oh what other outcome could there be but that their beautiful petals*would die?</l>
<l n="b">The fragrance of the <foreign>asana</foreign>, the jasmine, the <foreign>suraga</foreign>, even the luxuriant* <foreign>nagapuṣpa,</foreign> would be pointless</l>
<l n="c">If the bees shunned them and no longer desired to caress them,</l>
<l n="d">Just as the splendour of the moon would cease if the love-sick <foreign>cucur</foreign> bird abandoned it.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">‘My dearest mistress, you who are sister to the beauty of the fourth month,</l>
<l n="b">I know the meaning of your words, you are the pale* <foreign>aśoka</foreign> in bud.</l>
<l n="c">Oh alas! How it awakens my pity, dear one, to see your sweet charms so enfeebled.</l>
<l n="d">Indeed yours is the sad plight of a flower that withers the moment it is taken from a fragrant hair-knot.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">‘O maiden, look here, I, your servant, my jewel, will go to the prince.</l>
<l n="b">I will take this lovely petal as a token of your homage to him, the god of the love-sick.</l>
<l n="c">When he beholds your sweetness, how could he not be won over and long fervently for the ocean of honey,</l>
<l n="d">So that only in being engulfed in its centre, would he find respite for his passionate longing.’</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="15">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">It would take too long to tell of the thoughts of these women, whose hearts ached</l>
<l n="b">With the passion and bewilderment that engulfed them.</l>
<l n="c">They tossed restlessly, greatly distressed,</l>
<l n="d">Confused, carried away by desires that, though they tried to ward them off, overwhelmed them so.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">But the princess was not thus affected.</l>
<l n="b">She was listless and dispirited, and paid no heed to her surroundings.</l>
<l n="c">Her attendants and maids untiringly caressed her,</l>
<l n="d">Seeking words to bring her comfort.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Her pitiful moans became more acute,</l>
<l n="b">For her mind was in turmoil, preoccupied.</l>
<l n="c">Tormented and brooding, she was unable to sleep, </l>
<l n="d">As is the way of young girls.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The king’s decision, commanding her</l>
<l n="b">To be married now without delay,</l>
<l n="c">Was both the cause of her suffering</l>
<l n="d">And the reason for her deep bewilderment.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">She could hear the music of <foreign>geṇḍing</foreign> and drums outside,</l>
<l n="b">In merry, sweet accompaniment to the singing.</l>
<l n="c">The lovely strains of the <foreign>curing</foreign> cymbals of the <foreign>piḍuḍukan</foreign> ceremony,*</l>
<l n="d">Rang out the whole night long to torment her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">But enough of that. Night soon passed,</l>
<l n="b">And the waning moon went off to hide away.</l>
<l n="c">The seventh hour* rang out, </l>
<l n="d">As if inviting daylight to hasten there.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="16">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">When every kind of ceremonial requisite had been prepared and laid ready,</l>
<l n="b">The populace entered and assembled in the outer courtyard.</l>
<l n="c">At daybreak, the sun shone bright and clear, radiating its brilliance everywhere.</l>
<l n="d">The city gleamed brightly, crimson-red, and the <foreign>gĕṇḍing</foreign> resounded merrily.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">There in the outer hall, the king received homage,</l>
<l n="b">The exuberance of the court ever-increasing, like the rising ocean.</l>
<l n="c">Great throngs of people spread everywhere, scurrying busily about, </l>
<l n="d">The <foreign>saragi</foreign> gongs* crashing in joyful competition, like waves breaking.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Some people were merrily eating and drinking together, in full measure,</l>
<l n="b">The whole day spent happily in each other’s company, completely unrestrained, everything without fault.</l>
<l n="c">But let us tell now of the princess, in the pavilion, undergoing the <foreign>piḍuḍukan</foreign> ceremony.</l>
<l n="d">Her sweet charms rivalled those of Ratih, Goddess of Love, as she was adorned.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">As she was assiduously attended by those officiating* in the inner chamber</l>
<l n="b">And by those who adorned her in splendour, the maiden became more and more dejected,</l>
<l n="c">So upset at the king’s apparent disregard of her,</l>
<l n="d">That she could take no pleasure in the beauty of the decorations with which they adorned her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Although she was truly worthy to vanquish the beauty of the wondrous fourth month,</l>
<l n="b">Her sorrow made her as lifeless as a withered flower.</l>
<l n="c">The sun began to go down as if to hasten the wedding-night,</l>
<l n="d">While the awesome rumble of the thunder, with its soft and quavering sound, seemed a prelude to love-making.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Inside that beautiful pavilion the noble princess was attended.</l>
<l n="b">Moreover, because all the most beautiful adornments had been reserved for it,</l>
<l n="c">The <foreign>pamiḍuḍukan</foreign> pavilion was breath-takingingly lovely, quite enchanting.*</l>
<l n="d">While her maid servants, all thoroughly accomplished in the arts of beauty, were like heavenly nymphs.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">So great were her charms that she was like an ornamented painting of a goddess,</l>
<l n="b">Such an incomparable and excellent girl was she, the supreme jewel of the palace.</l>
<l n="c">The unending molten stream of the goddess of nectar would yield before her, infatuated,</l>
<l n="d">By her sweetness and would be reduced to confusion to see her own beauty take on visible form.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">The setting sun had sent its rays to keep watch over her painted lips.</l>
<l n="b">Clearly, rain-filled* clouds were in her hair-knot.</l>
<l n="c">Darting swallows flying about seemed to have become one with her frowning brows,</l>
<l n="d">And the flickering lightning had lost its brightness, in service to her feet.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Then the melodic sound of the prayers and rituals became louder,</l>
<l n="b">Its charm enhanced by the soft murmuring of those gathered in the outer court.</l>
<l n="c">The accompaniment of the lovely <foreign>gĕṇḍing</foreign> and <foreign>curing</foreign>* aroused feelings of longing,</l>
<l n="d">Their musical offering bringing to mind the tossing of the beautiful ocean.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">At sunset, the clouds shone like red silk.</l>
<l n="b">At the fifth hour the enchanting moon goddess rose and shone brightly.</l>
<l n="c">But, disheartened that this true incarnation of beauty mocked her </l>
<l n="d">And worsted her, she became pale and waited there, hidden behind the dark clouds that cast shadows across her [face].</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">The princess’s ornaments were so decoratively arranged by those waiting upon her</l>
<l n="b">That it seemed as if the beauty of the dawn was shamed and took leave of her charms.</l>
<l n="c">Indeed, all the sentiments of delight in a love-poem or the subtle allusions in an allegory*</l>
<l n="d">Were to be found in her sweetness and, if but whispered, would invoke feelings of love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">We will say no more of the princess but tell instead of the prince.*</l>
<l n="b">He was showered with all requisites and due ceremonies </l>
<l n="c">By the king,* who now arranged the wedding.</l>
<l n="d">In due time, the bridal couple withdrew. We will now tell of them.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">They went up together into the beautiful bed-chamber.</l>
<l n="b">That the rites of marriage* would be delightful, was plain for all to see in [the prince’s] desire.</l>
<l n="c">It was as if he had been overwhelmed with the unconstrained delight that is treasured on a delicately-made writing board</l>
<l n="d">And the beautiful princess was clearly the wondrousness of gentle rain.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">As the princess mounted the bedstead,</l>
<l n="b">Her heart was filled with dread and disquiet. Despondently she was led in.</l>
<l n="c">She was truly afraid because of the sorrow that now visited her,</l>
<l n="d">And she could find no solace, as she felt an unremitting sadness sweep over her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15"><l n="a">As they sat there together, all who saw them thought them delightful:</l>
<l n="b">‘Our princess is the image of a young banana leaf newly unfolding.</l>
<l n="c">The prince is like a profusion of <foreign>jangga</foreign> vine, unrestrainedly caressing her.’</l>
<l n="d">Thus they thought, full of longing, their wounded hearts captivated.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="17">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">So alluring and beautiful was the scene, with moonlight enhancing the beauty</l>
<l n="b">Of the bright, glowing pavilion, it was truly without equal.</l>
<l n="c">The lustrous radiance of the gold ridge-pole was augmented by jewels,</l>
<l n="d">And the light of the moon grew pale when irradiated by their gleam, sparkling in all directions.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The splendid draperies were like those used to curtain a grotto of love.</l>
<l n="b">The sun-red glowing horizon seemed to have moved there.</l>
<l n="c">Moreover the couch within the house of creepers was spread with softest silks.*</l>
<l n="d">Camphor and unguent gave forth their fragrance, diffusing their scent and perfumes overall.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The prince had already been enthroned* on the couch,</l>
<l n="b">And had taken the girl on his lap, where she lay deprived of strength, all atremble.</l>
<l n="c">When they were left alone there, he was just like a bee caressing a budding flower.</l>
<l n="d">He became more and more like an intoxicated <foreign>taḍaharṣa</foreign> bird paying homage to the moon, overwhelmed by longing.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Bewildered and wan, the beautiful girl grew ever more afraid, and sighed,</l>
<l n="b">Bending gracefully aside when he tried to seize her waist, moving away, warding him off.</l>
<l n="c">Overwhelming sadness totally crushed her heart into little pieces,</l>
<l n="d">And tears of honey suddenly welled up in her eyes, as she arched her brows threateningly.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">His heart beating wildly, the prince became more and more passionate.</l>
<l n="b">Clearly he was the embodiment of honey, blended with sweetest syrup,</l>
<l n="c">Akin to the thunder of the fourth month, that lightens the suffering of those overcome by the pains of love.</l>
<l n="d">And his words, droplets of sweet delight, were the essence of love:</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">‘O maiden! Queen of the beauty of <foreign>asanas</foreign>! Flower of the whole kingdom!</l>
<l n="b">You are my final destination, the very cause of my love-sick passions.</l>
<l n="c">All joy and desire embodied in an incomparably wrought jewel are you,</l>
<l n="d">The fulfilment of a dream, [a gift] from the God of Love, magically appearing.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">‘Therefore you have been accorded first place* by all beautiful women.</l>
<l n="b">Have pity on me, the one whose heart has striven to resist the dictates of the God of Love.</l>
<l n="c">Clearly it is because of my love-sick heart that I reach for you, seeking you out.</l>
<l n="d">And so I have come humbly to seek refuge with you, here in the bed-chamber.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Thus he spoke. But the maiden he sought to woo averted her face, weeping.</l>
<l n="b">Her body, lithe as a tendril, seemed to wilt, as she sighed plaintively.</l>
<l n="c">The prince’s passion was so intense,* so uncontrolled, that she grew very apprehensive</l>
<l n="d">As his intent gaze sought to reveal her secret places.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">‘O my darling, why do you treat my troubles so lightly as I seek your favour?</l>
<l n="b">Even though you stab me with your eyebrows, how could that be reason enough for me to go away and abandon myself to longing?</l>
<l n="c">I would think myself fortunate if I could but be pierced by your beautiful glances. What would I care if I were cut to pieces?</l>
<l n="d">My darling, my only hope is that I, who so desire you, might now receive the gift of your love.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">The object of his love-struck worship, weary of resisting, sank down, weeping,</l>
<l n="b">Helplessly striking at him with her hands as if she would blunt her nails.</l>
<l n="c">As he seized her waist-band, it suddenly came loose from her fragrant, slender waist.</l>
<l n="d">And though it seemed she would die as he threatened her thus, he ignored her fear and took possession of her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">Intent on his purpose, unable to restrain his mounting excitement, </l>
<l n="b">The prince abandoned himself to the overwhelming force of his boundless desire, quite without mercy.</l>
<l n="c">For it so assailed him that, in the end, he ravished* the beautiful princess,</l>
<l n="d">Pressing down* upon her trembling breasts, now laid bare, filling her with fear and aversion.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="18">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">After being thus deflowered, the weary maiden was completely devastated,</l>
<l n="b">Like a pale leaf that has just withered away.</l>
<l n="c">Gasping for breath, deprived of all strength, she rose and stumbling to the foot of the couch, sank down there,</l>
<l n="d">Her embroidered, fragrant robe stained with blood, glistening wet.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Aghast, she readjusted her clothing</l>
<l n="b">For fear of again being forced to make love.</l>
<l n="c">She went dejectedly from the fragrant boudoir,</l>
<l n="d">A sudden frown on her face at seeing the blood trickling to her feet.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Her maids, taken by surprise as she came out, greeted her:</l>
<l n="b">‘Dear mistress, pay no attention to your pain, my dear.</l>
<l n="c">Why it is just like taking betel – the first time, it is hot to the lips,</l>
<l n="d">But there is no doubt that the next time it, instead, becomes* delightful’.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">And so the princess was urged to return at once,</l>
<l n="b">With coaxing words as they bathed her face.</l>
<l n="c">The fear that filled her at their insistence, was plain to see</l>
<l n="d">As they escorted her back in soon after.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="19">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Thereupon, the heart of the lover she had abandoned in the beauty of that lovely bed-chamber became ever more inflamed.</l>
<l n="b">His tender gaze was heart-stopping and as sweet as a beautiful lotus.</l>
<l n="c">As rain in the fourth month, his words set her heart aquiver.</l>
<l n="d">He was like a yearning bee in the fragrant <foreign>asana,</foreign> intoxicated with beauty:</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">‘O maiden, jewel of all who love, enthroned in the innermost depths of my yearning heart, you hold me spell-bound with passion,</l>
<l n="b">Bringing to me the sharpest love-pangs, your arching brows wound my shattered heart.</l>
<l n="c">How can I not die when your eyes shine upon me, filling me with feelings of longing?</l>
<l n="d">And in captivating me with desire, you become the essence that forever fills my heart.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">‘But even if I, your brother, were to die, I could become your eye-black, your ear-ornaments, your breast-band, your robe.</l>
<l n="b">What pleasure I would know in heightening the beauty of your heart-melting glance, or drawing near in homage to your fragrant ear.</l>
<l n="c">On the couch I could caress your breasts, marked with the scratches [of love-making] and enclose your beautiful, lustrous waist.</l>
<l n="d">My darling, what joy would be mine if I were thus allowed to inhale the scent of your beauty.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">These were the prince’s loving words, telling her of the depth of his feelings, enchanting her.</l>
<l n="b">His words of love were fit to dispel the apprehension of any* love-lorn bride and put her fear to rest.</l>
<l n="c">But just as the sun grows cool at twilight, the princess was sad at heart and upset,</l>
<l n="d">And would not look at her lover’s delightful glances though, like syrup, they were sweet enough to carry her pain away.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">He found many sweet ways to alleviate the princess’s heartache.</l>
<l n="b">In joyful ecstasy, he kissed her as she lay with her head in his lap, stroking her breasts,</l>
<l n="c">Striving only for harmony in their love-making, steadfastly practising the meditation of the doctrines [of love],</l>
<l n="d">They seemed to drown in a sea of honey, caressed by the clouds of passion.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="20">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">After making love a second time, the princess was exhausted and deathly pale.</l>
<l n="b">Like the moon growing dim, the sweetness of her wan face had lost its lustre.</l>
<l n="c">Moreover the lamps shining upon her enhanced her charm, captivating</l>
<l n="d">The prince, who because of his boundless love, became even more ardent.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The onlookers, hiding behind the partitions there, were overcome by feelings of longing, tinged with desire,</l>
<l n="b">On hearing the soft rustlings and whispered endearments which seemed only to enhance their love-making.</l>
<l n="c">In time, weary of joining in love, they fell silent and slept, </l>
<l n="d">Without a thought for the clothes and wraps that they had left abandoned there, kicked aside.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">We will not tell of them as, replete with love-making, they slept* there on the couch.</l>
<l n="b">When day began to break, a fragrant breeze came wafting,</l>
<l n="c">Carrying with it the perfume of the <foreign>srī gaḍing</foreign>, <foreign>asana </foreign>and <foreign>kamuning</foreign> flowers</l>
<l n="d">And the enchantment of secret places that, like a bed chamber, conjure up visions of love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Delightfully, the distant call of the <foreign>kokila</foreign> could be faintly heard.</l>
<l n="b">The peacocks, carolling joyfully on the gate-posts, were enchanting.</l>
<l n="c">The bees, buzzing in their hives, sounded like ardent husbands* kissing each of their wives</l>
<l n="d">In a frenzy of delight, aroused by the <foreign>asanas</foreign> and the fragrant, beautiful pandanus flowers.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="21">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The bright Lord of the Sun was just beginning to shine</l>
<l n="b">As radiantly as a half smile that hints at passion.</l>
<l n="c">Glowing rays of light spread sparkling on all sides,</l>
<l n="d">And burnished* clouds shone with brilliant streaks.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The hand-maidens had completed their preparations,</l>
<l n="b">And stood in readiness on the outer verandah.</l>
<l n="c">They brought there all that they needed for bathing,</l>

</div>
<div type="canto" n="22">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">But the loving couple, enveloped in weariness from love-making, did not know that day had come.</l>
<l n="b">They were surprised when they awoke to find their clothes in disarray and rearranged them.</l>
<l n="c">They emerged, eyes blinking, from the bridal chamber,</l>
<l n="d">And were then bathed together by their attentive maids.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Emerging from the water,* they sat there together on the verandah outside the pavilion,</l>
<l n="b">Joyfully sitting so closely layered together,* with the princess on his lap,</l>
<l n="c">They looked as beautiful as a god and goddess descending from the heavens,</l>
<l n="d">With the serving-girls waiting upon them, each appropriately adorned,* seated below them according to rank.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">They were ill-at-ease, lingering there on the verandah,</l>
<l n="b">Thrown into confusion by sudden thoughts of the sweetness of the partner who had brought them such bliss.</l>
<l n="c">The gleam in their love-filled eyes seemed to compel them to return,</l>
<l n="d">And again they climbed up to the couch, there to discover the joy of their nakedness.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Truly splendid was all that was used to regale them during the marriage ceremonies.*</l>
<l n="b">Softly, as if to soothe them, the sweet strains of the <foreign>gĕṇḍing</foreign> sang out their praises,</l>
<l n="c">And the fragrance of the perfumes, boreh and bdellium wafted there,</l>
<l n="d">Thus arousing their passion and making them eager for love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">The fourth hour sounded out, a signal for them to come out of the pavilion together.</l>
<l n="b">Then delicious foods prepared in full measure were placed before them,</l>
<l n="c">The elderly women keeping close watch over every detail of the offerings,</l>
<l n="d">As lute players and graceful dancers fulfilled their every request and desire.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">They became Kāma and Ratih as they sought union in the bed-chamber.</l>
<l n="b">Because of their boundless mutual passion they found harmony, burgeoning together in the raptures of love.</l>
<l n="c">Their enjoyment was that of the delighted meeting of the sap of the fruit of the betel and sharp tooth.</l>
<l n="d">The consummation of their union awakening joy in the faces of her mother and father.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="23">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">With that, the king’s mind indeed became tranquil.</l>
<l n="b">The joy of the people throughout the kingdom returned in equal measure.*</l>
<l n="c">Prosperity immediately brought back the might of heroes throughout the land,</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">We will not tell of the many months that the two lovers lived in mutual delight,</l>

<l n="c">Their every action touched their hearts to the core,*</l>
<l n="d">Their love for each other like that of the <foreign>mangunĕng</foreign> flower, closely entwined with the <foreign>jangga</foreign> vine.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">And so the king knew unbounded love in great measure, </l>
<l n="b">Because the prince had caused his heart to be free of care,</l>

</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The rumbling thunder [of the fourth month], that season that summons wanderers to surrender themselves to the pursuit of beauty, arrived.</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Having received the consent of his beloved, he took leave</l>

<div type="canto" n="24">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Delightful were the lovely fragrances from the flower gardens as the breeze caught them. The cry of the peacock was enchanting,</l>

<l n="c">Night had passed and the landscape came into view through a curtain of falling rain.</l>
<l n="d">For all the world like jewels scattered everywhere, rain drops filled the fields.</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The newly-risen sun shone in the east, a shower of sparkling rays radiating down into the mountain gullies.</l>
<l n="b">The glittering forest trees were at their best, their shimmering branches vibrant.</l>
<l n="c">The joyful sound of the wood-fowl* in the gorges rang out,* as male and female, in repose, called back and forth* to each other.</l>
<l n="d">And the cuckoo’s cry sounded loudly* as if inspired by the mountain view.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Trees that had abandoned hope and shrivelled, now bathed with dew,* put forth new leaves.</l>
<l n="b">Delightedly, young bael creepers* opened, thrusting their tendrils out sideways.</l>
<l n="c">Curling fronds of <foreign>katirah</foreign> spiralled down and blended into the gold* trees,</l>
<l n="d">Encircling the overhanging <foreign>wanañjari</foreign>* in its embrace, as if longing to form a bower* for lovers.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Along the sides of the mountain ridges, the cultivated fields, lit by the sun’s rays, gleamed.</l>
<l n="b">Ivory betel-nut palms, heavily laden with coconuts, their fruit ripe for picking, stood in delightful rows.</l>
<l n="c">On the slopes were verdant rice-fields, bananas grew abundantly in the ravines,</l>
<l n="d">Their leaves, lying on the ground where they had fallen, like blunted styluses.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">The crops were green and lovely, freshly shining, wet with dew.</l>
<l n="b">Millet and rattan, tuberous roots and <foreign>payanggu</foreign> were in full bloom, there were aubergines neatly planted along the small dykes.*</l>
<l n="c">Garden plots had been established in the near-by valleys, the glistening soil newly tilled.</l>
<l n="d">Unfolding taro, just beginning to show its flowers,* looked like rolled-leaf ear ornaments of ivory.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The graceful young leaves of the <foreign>lirang</foreign> looked for all the world like the naked waists of maidens.</l>
<l n="b">As if throwing themselves down on the ground in dejection, prey to feelings of longing and sadness, the withering <foreign>jangga</foreign> vines were mad with desire.</l>
<l n="c">The ivory coconuts were like uncovered breasts in the fullness of their beauty,</l>
<l n="d">Indeed, they seemed to have stolen the loveliness of a yearning maiden, secretly seeking the raptures of love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a"><foreign>Cangkilung</foreign> birds sang sweetly in the ravines, accompanied by the answering calls of <foreign>pings</foreign>.*</l>
<l n="b">Shyly they called out,* sobbing and yearning as they waited in the <foreign>rangin</foreign> trees.</l>
<l n="c">‘Ooooo’, came the soughing of the rustling wind, whistling through* the <foreign>wungwang</foreign> bamboo,* bringing delight,</l>
<l n="d">And just to hear the heart-stopping cry of the <foreign>pakṣi kĕtur</foreign> birds seemed* to awaken emotions of love.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="25">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">As the prince proceeded on his journey, one splendid vista after another unfolded before his eyes.</l>
<l n="b">Emerging from a leafy wood, he entered a peaceful valley.</l>
<l n="c">The dry rice-fields were beautiful, their plants a balm to the eyes.*</l>
<l n="d">What a pity they had been so neglected! Perhaps hermits who had once sought solitude* there had been rendered powerless by magical forces and worsted.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Along the sides of the path, well-kept fields rising up in terraces </l>
<l n="b">Towered above the settlements located at the foot of the mountain.</l>
<l n="c">In the bright sunlight, he could see them all clearly as he looked down,</l>
<l n="d">But they disappeared from view as they zigzagged* in and out of the distant hollows.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The gardens came right up to the undergrowth* which seemed intent on invading the hermitage,</l>
<l n="b">But it seemed to hesitate uncertainly, lest in the heat of the sun, the valley road would be as [hot as] a cauldron,*</l>
<l n="c">It kept constant guard against the wickedness* of the naughty monkeys, seeking to steal the plants and crops,</l>
<l n="d">As well as the terrible forest boars that were treacherously determined to destroy everything,* so fierce were they.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Stands of bending ivory coconut palms charmingly waiting there on the hill, beckoned.*</l>
<l n="b">Delightful in their exuberance,* they lent enchantment to the haunts of poets composing verse,</l>
<l n="c">But their invitation to the chattering lemurs, half-hidden there, seemed to no avail*</l>
<l n="d">In the face of the incessant loud clattering of the alarms* that frightened them all away unharmed.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Determined to convey the message of beauty, <foreign>gagarangan</foreign> trees* bedecked themselves with garlands of flower, </l>
<l n="b">But they had forgotten their true nature - that they had no fragrance at all - and stood tall and lofty.*</l>
<l n="c">In boldly challenging the beauty of <foreign>asanas</foreign> in the fourth month like this and trying to replace it,</l>
<l n="d">They were quite in error, for it was quite impossible they could ever cause desire.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The <foreign>kamwagan</foreign> diffused its fragrance to envelop the artful <foreign>pupulutan</foreign>*flowers.</l>
<l n="b">Wanting to mingle together with them and give prominence to its own perfume,* it seemed to take delight* in such fraudulent and impudent behaviour.</l>
<l n="c">Enhancing its beauty with red <foreign>pilapilu,</foreign>* gleefully planning to lie in wait in the gullies,</l>
<l n="d">The <foreign>singgugu</foreign> shrub lay ready, its flowers languidly scattered and strewn about to form a mat.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">In full blossom, the <foreign>wunga tali</foreign> seemed to tremble, giving itself airs, though it seemed absurd that it could ever wound a heart.</l>
<l n="b">Far from hiding itself away, it acted quite wrongly, showing too little self control.</l>
<l n="c">As if maddened, it tried to discover the secrets of the <foreign>mandalīka</foreign> calling to it, though it sullenly shook its head,</l>
<l n="d">Drawing itself up to its full height, ignoring the passion that filled it, reached outwards, and was trapped.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">In this way, the beauties of the countryside were set before the prince on his journey.</l>
<l n="b">The ascetics all came out according to rank to meet him as he travelled on his way,</l>
<l n="c">Bidding him welcome, warmly offering him every efficacious herb and medicine as well as delicious fruits.</l>
<l n="d">Joyfully, and attentive to every detail, he [in turn] presented them with the gifts due from a prince.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Many country people, not to mention a great number of their leaders, attended him.</l>
<l n="b">Abundant were their gifts of delicacies: there were fruits and roots and sweet, young coconuts,</l>
<l n="c">Palm wine and <foreign>kilang.</foreign>* All that they had in their stores, they offered humbly,</l>
<l n="d">Pleasing the prince so much that he wished to linger there.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">By the time he was ready to set off again to visit the many beauty spots in the forest, </l>
<l n="b">The sun had set, and so he made ready to spend the night,</l>
<l n="c">There, in the hermitage, with his entire escort* carefully keeping watch,</l>
<l n="d">While all the <foreign>duwan</foreign>* came forward in rank to attend to his every need.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="26">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">When night had passed, the prince again went on his way in search of beauty,</l>
<l n="b">Making his way along the edges of the ravines, along the dips and bends of the magnificent mountain.</l>
<l n="c">He was charmed by the sound of the musical watermills, faintly audible in the distance, tinkling sweetly one after the other in the gullies.</l>
<l n="d">The muted roar of a waterfall, that could be heard now and then, entranced him.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Valleys lay open to view in the curves of the hills, the forests along their slopes</l>
<l n="b">So charmingly spread out below, but covered now with white clouds, were scarcely visible.</l>
<l n="c">Low clouds came down, blanketing them, then dispersing again like the remnants of night,</l>
<l n="d">So that for a moment the <foreign>walik-aḍĕp</foreign> trees* flickered, then, as if suddenly called away, unable to wait, vanished.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The sun now shone as radiantly as the face of a beloved in the bed-chamber.</l>
<l n="b">Taking flight, the dew formed stripes on the grass then sought a hiding place.</l>
<l n="c">As the mist was finally swept away, the hermitages on the hill sides, where the ascetics dwelt, </l>
<l n="d">Burnished brightly by the sun, were like white doves flashing past.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Gleefully, the members of his escort* scattered, spreading out everywhere along the valleys, clinging* to the mountain ridges.</l>
<l n="b">Some were leaping about, others made their way* to peaks north and south.</l>
<l n="c">Merrily, joyfully, seeking out the delights of the forested hills.</l>
<l n="d">The reverberating sounds of their hunting* echoed as they wandered about there tumultuously.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Content, the prince descended from his chariot and went off in search of the beauties of nature.</l>
<l n="b">‘Indeed I will go into the woods, there I will surely find them’, he thought to himself,</l>
<l n="c">And he went on unescorted, separating himself from the others so that there would be none to observe him.</l>
<l n="d">Then gradually leaving them behind, he wandered further away, ever more absorbed in beauty.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The prince now became enthralled by the delightful ornaments that the forest held in readiness for him.</l>
<l n="b">Far below, a small pavilion that looked like a mushroom nestling on the steep slopes of the rocky, pitted terrain, bade him welcome.</l>
<l n="c">There the prince rested, gazing intently up at the splendid roof-beam,</l>
<l n="d">Where a name, faint now but still distinguishable, remained there for others to find and ponder.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">He could just make out another hermitage at the edge of the ravine which majestically towered above.</l>
<l n="b">The penance of the ascetics who lived there must have been powerful beyond words,</l>
<l n="c">For they were served* by female ascetics who would certainly bring failure to any who strove* to subdue their senses,</l>
<l n="d">Always planning to weave their charms to bewitch* the concentration of the seers.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">A gliding river of unearthly beauty appeared like a vision in a dream,</l>
<l n="b">And from the mountain peak high above, it seemed to have formed a beach below.</l>
<l n="c">Along the edges of its beautiful banks, rock-platforms waited invitingly,</l>
<l n="d">As if to decree that such beauty depicted in verse, could only be found in the poem of the prince of poets.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">In the middle of the water, he could just make out a reef, thrusting upward.</l>
<l n="b">Even as the waves washed over it, caressing it and bespattering it with water, it stood unyielding.</l>
<l n="c">Moreover, a veil of spray sought out the graceful pandanus draped* there,</l>
<l n="d">With their naked flowers trailing, as if to capture the attention of wanderers in pursuit of beauty.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">On reflection, these subtle hints of the wondrous appearance of the river-bank seemed</l>
<l n="b">Designed to distract even the rapt attention of the one seeking the riddle of a name.</l>
<l n="c"><foreign>Kinnara </foreign>birds* and swallows flew down to it.</l>
<l n="d">Some became entangled in the reeds* after bathing there, longing* to find a resting place to share.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">Herons swam in formation in the water, some standing there like mendicant monks,</l>
<l n="b">Preening their feathers* as an excuse for looking intently* into the holes of the mud-eels.</l>
<l n="c">Merrily, the warblers twittered incessantly, then went off together in pairs, flying into the air.</l>
<l n="d">The peacocks fell silent, content to go on dancing and remain in the water.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="27">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The prince became more and more delighted when he saw</l>
<l n="b">That pure and crystal-clear mountain stream,</l>
<l n="c">And so, drawing near to bathe his face,</l>
<l n="d">He descended to the depths of that flawless river.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">There he performed the most excellent, paramount ritual gestures,</l>
<l n="b">Praying to the Lord of One Thousand Rays, the Sun.</l>
<l n="c">Together with the recitation of esoteric formulas,* his meditation</l>
<l n="d">Penetrated to the highest* inconceivable truth.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="28">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">As the excellent Phalguṇa was praying, his mind calm and undisturbed, tranquil and pure,*</l>
<l n="b">A gigantic, mighty crocodile, guardian of the river, suddenly appeared.</l>
<l n="c">Its presence there was the reason that no-one* came near and that it was so deserted,</l>
<l n="d">But now it caught the fragrant scent of the noble Pārtha. </l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Immediately, its ferocity awakened, for it was wild with hunger,</l>
<l n="b">Burning with savage frenzy, so long had it been without food.</l>
<l n="c">There it was spanning* the river, its mouth open wide, its fangs protruding sideways,</l>
<l n="d">And protuberances* all over its face, so that it resembled the terrifying and awesome [demon] Rāhu.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">It saw the prince, undaunted and confident,</l>
<l n="b">Awaiting its attack. Swiftly it drew near,* but just as it was about to pounce,</l>
<l n="c">He too advanced steadily, joined with it, </l>
<l n="d">Spinning around and feinting fearlessly.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Swiftly, loudly, they clashed, keeping each other constantly in view, and as they came to grips,</l>
<l n="b">The river seemed to open wide, its waters rising up and crashing down.</l>
<l n="c">As if it were being stirred, it eddied in the centre, mud spewed forth,</l>
<l n="d">As if they were scooping it up as they assailed each other, angrily attacking.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">In violent commotion, they circled each other, lunging unexpectedly, grappling tirelessly, never weakening,</l>
<l n="b">Skilfully and confidently attacking each other from all sides, without fear.</l>
<l n="c">In turn they grabbed at each other, clawed at each other, locked in the battle of their furious assault,</l>
<l n="d">Sometimes dancing about each other in their struggle, then joining once again in combat.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">It seemed their struggle would never end, when, suddenly,* the crocodile looked to be worsted,</l>
<l n="b">Momentarily off-guard, as Arjuna quickly seized it and spun it around as if it were weightless.</l>
<l n="c">He dashed it down swiftly* upon a sharp rock, breaking its jaw,</l>
<l n="d">Its neck* snapped and thus it was rendered powerless by Phalguṇa.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">With that, the prince hauled it to the surface of the earth.</l>
<l n="b">He looked in amazement upon its appearance in death.</l>
<l n="c">For he thought himself bewitched, as he gazed upon a heavenly nymph.</l>
<l n="d">Indeed, he could only think that this dead monster was strikingly beautiful.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">An uninterrupted rain of flowers fell on the prince;</l>
<l n="b">Buzzing bees circled him, moving from flower to flower.*</l>
<l n="c">Such was the gift of homage that fell at the feet of Phalguṇa</l>
<l n="d">And the prince, deeply gratified, sought an explanation.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="29">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Then the heavenly nymph spoke out.</l>
<l n="b">‘Indeed, I, your servant, am a celestial being,</l>

<l n="d">My name is none other than Sarwadā.*</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">‘I also have four beautiful sisters, nymphs all,</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">‘There a great seer was performing powerful yoga,</l>
<l n="b">Undertaking religious austerities, without equal in the three worlds.</l>

</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">‘In his anger he cast a curse upon us: “Hey! You who scorn me!</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">‘We then moved swiftly off in search of a river.</l>
<l n="b">When we came to Awindhya, we came upon him again.</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">‘With those words he went on his way.</l>

<div type="canto" n="30">
    <p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Thus said the celestial woman to the noble Pārtha.</l>
<l n="b">The prince was willing to accede to her gentle words.</l>
<l n="c">Setting off* with the heavenly nymph,</l>
<l n="d">They travelled swiftly, without stopping to rest.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">They came to the beautiful but inaccessible pools where the other crocodiles lived.</l>
<l n="b">There he lifted them up and released them all.</l>
<l n="c">They were delighted to be nymphs once again,</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Thus they spoke. The prince was delighted:</l>
<l n="b">‘O nymphs! How could I fail in my purpose?</l>
<l n="c">It was only the proper <foreign>dharma</foreign>* of a man of virtue in this world</l>
<l n="d">That I have followed, in taking upon myself* the burden of your sorrow.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">It was not for silver, gold, jewels or profit</l>
<l n="b">That I rescued you from your time of trouble.</l>
<l n="c">It befits a <foreign>kṣatriya</foreign> warrior to ensure no cruelty befalls the world.</l>
<l n="d">He should strive only to devote himself to such meritorious deeds.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Thus said the excellent Pārtha in explanation.</l>
<l n="b">It was as if the heavenly nymphs had been sprinkled with the water of life,</l>
<l n="c">For they had received his most exalted favour,</l>
<l n="d">And did not know how to repay such kindness that was as great as Mount Meru.</l>

<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">‘We have enjoyed your unbounded favour,</l>

<l n="c">May you be unimpeded, my lord, in obtaining your desires and the victory you seek!</l>
<l n="d">You are indeed the refuge of the defenceless, O protector of the earth!’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Many were their praises of Prince Pārtha.</l>
<l n="b">We will not tell of them. Having taken leave of him,</l>

<l n="d">Towards heaven. But we will say no more of this.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Pārtha was left alone, love-lorn and weak with desire,</l>
<l n="b">Prey to his emotions as he stared up into the heavens, totally bemused.</l>
<l n="c">His heart missed a sudden beat as he caught the sound of distant thunder,</l>
<l n="d">There in the west, for it seemed like the voices of those heavenly women.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">For a long time he sat in contemplation. When the sun had gone down</l>
<l n="b">It became even more still there on the bank of the river.</l>
<l n="c">Gently* it whispered [to him] as he watched the eddying stream. </l>
<l n="d">‘I have been purified,’ it rippled, in proof that its waters* were free of danger.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">Now we will tell of the members of his escort who came running up at the double,</l>
<l n="b">Competing with each other to be first there, trying to overtake each other.</l>
<l n="c">With great merriment and in high spirits, some engaged in ferocious hand-to hand-combat,</l>
<l n="d">So eager were they to hear about the heavenly women.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">And so the prince waited there.</l>
<l n="b">But we will tell now of the great ascetics of the hermitage.</l>
<l n="c">All who lived in the vicinity of the Swabhadra river</l>
<l n="d">Had heard of the removal of the danger from their holy bathing place.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">They were so delighted to be afraid no longer,</l>
<l n="b">That they quickly set off together to go* at once to the noble one.</l>
<l n="c">Coming upon the excellent Pārtha resting there,</l>
<l n="d">They were astounded by his splendid appearance.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">Arjuna greeted the arrival of the hermits with great respect</l>
<l n="b">And sat politely, legs crossed, quiet and tranquil.</l>
<l n="c">The sages* said: ‘How fortunate it is that you have come here now</l>
<l n="d">To the Swabhadra, the lovely abode of we hermits.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15"><l n="a">‘And we say to you, O Prince, that by your actions in coming to these wooded mountains,</l>

<l n="c">Your victory in this world is clearly ordained by the gods.</l>
<l n="d">Indeed, we believe that you will obtain your goal and all that you strive for.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="16"><l n="a">Thus said the seers. The prince replied sincerely,</l>
<l n="b">‘As you look so kindly, Sirs, on one such as I, </l>
<l n="c">May I be the sacrifice for you whose aim is to perform virtuous deeds,</l>
<l n="d">In your wish to be free of the <foreign>karma</foreign> of the three worlds.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="17"><l n="a">These were his words. Thereupon, in homage they brought him</l>
<l n="b">Water to wash his feet, water to rinse his mouth, such as is due to a guest, as well as betel leaf and nut,</l>
<l n="c">And medicinal herbs, not to mention delicious fruits and tubers.</l>
<l n="d">All were offered to him by the anchoresses with all requisite ceremony.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="18"><l n="a">They were amazed just to look upon the noble Pārtha.</l>
<l n="b">‘How extraordinary he is! He is the god of Love who has come here to earth,</l>
<l n="c">With the purpose of hunting out beauty, consuming us with fire,</l>
<l n="d">Spitefully destroying our vows and meditation,’ they thought.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="19"><l n="a">Then the groups of hermits all decreed</l>
<l n="b">That Pārtha should immediately be honoured by the seers* themselves.</l>
<l n="c">When he had been thus honoured,* he became even more content</l>
<l n="d">And after a while the great abbot again spoke:</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="20"><l n="a">‘O Prince! You are our most excellent refuge,</l>
<l n="b">Protecting all the monks and their kin.</l>
<l n="c">Because none but you has the gift of your virtuous nature*</l>
<l n="d">We have witnessed* your triumph as you have attained your desires.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="21"><l n="a">‘And yet I will offer you my insignificant advice, if you will but listen.</l>
<l n="b">As long as happiness increases, then difficulties will be suffered.</l>
<l n="c">The origin of the love of others is invisible and therefore it is eternal.</l>
<l n="d">It is thus the most important thing, the foremost embodiment of <foreign>dharma</foreign>.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="22"><l n="a">‘For this [love] alone, you should truly search the depths of the self,*</l>
<l n="b">Just as the foremost champion in battle always* fosters unity,</l>
<l n="c">So that proper conduct ensues and thereby increases,</l>
<l n="d">And his enemies, therefore, cannot attack.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="23"><l n="a">‘It is no different in the three worlds than in your body.</l>
<l n="b">There can be no hostility because of kindness and freedom from passion. </l>
<l n="c">Neither enemies from within nor without can assail you.</l>
<l n="d">And you can be wholly unconstrained* and free from danger in obtaining your desires.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="24"><l n="a">Thus was the form of the doctrine that he expounded* so properly.</l>
<l n="b">Dhanañjaya welcomed it,</l>
<l n="c">For indeed its sentiments were truly appropriate.</l>
<l n="d">In short this was their discussion. But we will say no more of it.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="25"><l n="a">Night fell and the excellent and noble Pārtha spent it</l>
<l n="b">There in the hermitage, the ascetics,*</l>
<l n="c">Full of laughter and delight discussed* how the prosperity of the hermitage</l>
<l n="d">Had been magically altered by the prince’s supernatural potency.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="26"><l n="a">The prince enjoyed staying there in the place that had been prepared for him</l>
<l n="b">In an open pavilion, bright, clean and well-appointed.</l>
<l n="c">In his private quarters, he was again fêted,</l>
<l n="d">For the community of ascetics was not yet ready to retire.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="27"><l n="a">In every respect the enchanting hermitage, so still and lovely, was delightful,</l>
<l n="b">With the moon adding the lustre* of its pale, gleaming rays</l>
<l n="c">Like a lamp shining down upon the lights of the hermitage.</l>
<l n="d">The wafting fragrance of the lovely areca blossoms permeated everywhere.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="28"><l n="a">Disturbed and stirred by the delightful sighing of the ivory bamboo swaying in the cooling breeze,</l>
<l n="b">The bees sobbed in their holes with muffled song,</l>
<l n="c">Beset by love-sickness now that night had come and they were separated* from the <foreign>aśoka</foreign> and <foreign>tañjung</foreign> flowers,</l>
<l n="d">Arousing feelings of tender emotion in the prince’s heart.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="29"><l n="a">The seers discoursed happily on many matters</l>
<l n="b">And the prince, Phalguṇa, was delighted to join in,</l>
<l n="c">Now that the heavenly women had been restored to their true nature.</l>
<l n="d">But we will not tell of the night. It quickly passed.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="30"><l n="a">The following morning, the prince went from there.</l>
<l n="b">His journey along the forest paths* will not be recounted.</l>
<l n="c">He came to Mayūra, where he was greeted with joy,</l>
<l n="d">By all the delighted women of the palace.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="31">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">On his return he lived in contentment with his wife in the palace for a long time.</l>
<l n="b">The whole country was overwhelmed by perfect joy,</l>
<l n="c">And the king was transported with delight because of Arjuna.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">We will pass over how they came together in harmony in joyous love-making.</l>
<l n="b">They brought into the world a child, a model of comeliness and virtue,</l>
<l n="c">The excellent Wabhruwāhana, who was presented [to the king] by his father.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The king then performed the many excellent rituals prescribed, </l>
<l n="b">Overjoyed to obtain this jewel of the ocean.</l>
<l n="c">Such was the king’s happiness.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">None other than the prince himself occupied the hearts of the whole court, particularly those of the inner appartments.</l>
<l n="b">They wished to serve him alone,</l>
<l n="c">For they looked to him to be the protector of the world.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Their former sorrow was best described* as that of blades of grass,</l>
<l n="b">Withering as they hoped for rain to fall from the clouds.</l>
<l n="c">Now, deluged with rain, they were truly bursting with new life.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">All the royal domains, even the rural districts, were perfect.</l>
<l n="b">All were prosperous, no longer over-shadowed,</l>
<l n="c">So radiant, they seemed to outshine the sun and the moon.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Long would be the telling of the joy throughout the land.</l>
<l n="b">Our account now turns again to the prince,</l>
<l n="c">Who kept constantly in mind the advice of the great ascetic.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Furthermore, the end of the eleventh year had almost arrived,</l>
<l n="b">And so he again prepared to move on,</l>
<l n="c">His resolute heart unwavering.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">The prince took his beloved in his arms and addressed her with consoling words,</l>
<l n="b">Telling her of his certain promise,</l>
<l n="c">That in the future he would return to serve her.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">The excellent princess, fully understanding his intention, was untroubled</l>
<l n="b">Indeed, she never deviated from the teachings of highest truth,</l>
<l n="c">Unwilling to transgress [what is expected of] a beautiful woman.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">So, worthy princess that she was, she did not demur,</l>
<l n="b">Unable to entertain evil thoughts,</l>
<l n="c">Even if ordered to undertake lowly work.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">So Dhanañjaya appeared in the presence of the king to take his leave.</l>
<l n="b">The king offered no opposition,</l>
<l n="c">For he was truly a virtuous and honest man, a worthy example to the world.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="32">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">In short, after he had sought leave to depart he went from the palace straight away.</l>
<l n="b">He walked without haste along the path, relaxed and totally absorbed in beauty.</l>
<l n="c">He was filled with wonder at the sight of all the scenic beauties of the country-side, which seemed never to weary of trying to detain him, holding themselves in readiness* for him.</l>
<l n="d">Standing ready in the hope that they would catch sight of him, they waited overhead.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Both sides of the path seemed to have spread out their charms for his sideways glance.</l>
<l n="b">So astounded were they, and so oppressed with grief when he passed them by, that they could only stand there.</l>
<l n="c">As if disturbed and despondent, the red flowers of the flame tree sighed and trembled when he ignored them.</l>
<l n="d">Tossing restlessly, the bamboos swayed back and forth, exhausted as the wind beat them and they knocked against each other.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">There was a settlement of great splendour, its many buildings scattered here and there, the pathways knowing how to give pleasure.</l>
<l n="b">Its carefully tended beauty was its gift of welcome if any should happen by.</l>
<l n="c">Along the edge was a pure mountain stream, encircling the sides of the square,</l>
<l n="d">Where women went to draw water from the bathing pools, while others immersed themselves,* all were beautiful to behold.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">It certainly seemed as if they wanted to conceal themselves within an encircling ring of relatives.*</l>
<l n="b">Their graceful movements were accompanied by the enchanting tabours, sweetly keeping tune with the <foreign>kangsi</foreign>.</l>
<l n="c">How tantalizing* they were as they adorned themselves with flowers, the flower ornaments in their hair bands were beautifully arranged,</l>
<l n="d">But as they made their flower offerings, they became agitated at seeing the splendid prince as he passed by.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">How delightful were the charms that the prince beheld as he went on his way.</l>
<l n="b">There was a row of springs, with fountains cascading down to form a crystal-clear pond,</l>
<l n="c">A place where fresh lotuses gathered to form an encircling wall which, like the face of a beautiful girl, overflowed with sweetness,</l>
<l n="d">Their beauty constantly veiled by the spray of the water which covered them like fragrant powder.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The outer walls were magnificent, perfect in design and construction.</l>
<l n="b">The walls of the storehouses* within were made of bricks and merged into the enclosing parapet with its towering gateways.</l>
<l n="c">Wholly unconstrained, fronds of slender <foreign>bhujanggapuṣpa</foreign> beckoned excitedly, </l>
<l n="d">As the wind continually pestered them wickedly, and they tossed and waved.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">As if to ornament the radiant beauty of the <foreign>jring</foreign>, the beautiful <foreign>wĕlas-harĕp</foreign> creeper was like a cloth of gold.*</l>
<l n="b">Showing themselves in all their richness, the magnificent red lotuses* were skilled at enticing* the lovely umbrella-pandanus [to open].</l>
<l n="c">The bees took flight as if, now they were no longer able to caress or ravish the flowers, they had come to a sudden stop, filled with great disappointment,</l>
<l n="d">And seemed to lose heart as the wind, telling them of charms of the jasmine, pushed them roughly aside.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Moreover, the lovely marsh-land enhanced the splendour of the scene depicted.</l>
<l n="b">Its charms seemed to long to accompany the prince on his journey, and reached out to draw near him.</l>
<l n="c">Looking down, he could see the delightful banks where pandanus, pendant with flowers, grew along the edges</l>
<l n="d">And a rich profusion of radiant <foreign>śatapatra</foreign> lotuses opened out their shimmering petals and beckoned to the bees.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">The banks, where <foreign>surāga</foreign> and <foreign>rājasa</foreign> flowers blossomed,* were like a flower-strewn bed-chamber.</l>
<l n="b">The <foreign>campaka</foreign> were downcast, their display* to no avail because they had not yet been plucked by a wanderer in pursuit of beauty.</l>
<l n="c">Abandoned thus, they resigned themselves to their yearning, for no poet, eloping with his beloved, had come there to pick them,</l>
<l n="d">So that they were now willing to die and let their beauty slip away, by allowing their flowers to surrender their lives and float down, wilting, into the water.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">It would take too long to tell of the path or of the prince’s thoughts if we were to continue.</l>
<l n="b">He went quickly on his way. We will not tell of the time he spent surrendering himself to beauty.</l>
<l n="c">Soon after, he came to the shore,* where great beauty is ever to be found.</l>
<l n="d">So vast were its bright waters, that they seemed to merge on the horizon with the sky, then vanish from sight.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="33">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The shore-line brought him transports of delight,</l>
<l n="b">With its beautiful inlets, so enchanting.</l>
<l n="c">A river of clear water</l>
<l n="d">Seemed to present its beauty as a gift to the ocean.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Birds wandered about in search of food* on the water’s edge.</l>
<l n="b">Some were white, and, as they meandered everywhere,*</l>
<l n="c">Stretching in a line, moving together in a row,</l>
<l n="d">They were like jasmine flowers, worn in unbound tresses.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Like the unloosened ties of a <foreign>kain</foreign> were the ripple marks of the waves on the sand.</l>
<l n="b">Happily, the lovely <foreign>himi-himi</foreign> crabs rested there,</l>
<l n="c">Suddenly waving their pincers rapidly to and fro</l>
<l n="d">As they scuttled away, burrowing down into the sand as the waves* receded.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">On an outcrop of glistening coral reef,</l>
<l n="b">Crabs were exposed and lay there clinging.</l>
<l n="c">Throngs* of mussels hung there, </l>
<l n="d">Shining emerald-green* in the sun’s radiant light.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">The many prawns, entrenched on the rocks,</l>
<l n="b">Frightened away the birds who were eyeing them.</l>
<l n="c">Some came soaring through the air, wanting to land there,</l>
<l n="d">But they tried in vain to swoop down, for they were so startled, they flew off again in a flash.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">In great numbers, fish leapt up, thrown high in the air.</l>
<l n="b">One after the other they burst forth, darting to and fro.</l>
<l n="c">The porpoises and grey mullet, colliding,</l>
<l n="d">Made the little fish dart away* as they hurtled down on top of them.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Waves rolled in, crashing down</l>
<l n="b">As if they had been tossed aside and hurled away by a huge <foreign>timi</foreign> fish.*</l>
<l n="c">Strands of seaweed* lay strewn about on all sides,</l>
<l n="d">Like embroidered silk, decorating the wet sand.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Wave after wave crashed onto the shore</l>
<l n="b">Suddenly giving off a rain-bearing mist,</l>
<l n="c">Creating a shimmering rainbow</l>
<l n="d">That extended, jewel-bright, as far as the eye could see.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Shellfish and mussels* of many sorts were scattered here and there</l>
<l n="b">On shining fronds* spread like mats.</l>
<l n="c">As the waves receded, they clattered,* trying to outdo each other,</l>
<l n="d">Scraping continuously against the rocks in violent commotion.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">The foothills of the mountain were delightful.</l>
<l n="b">They extended far into the ocean’s maw.</l>
<l n="c">In the deep recesses of their caves, </l>
<l n="d">Rock swallows slipped away, flying off together.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">Far away in the distance was an island,</l>
<l n="b">Barely visible in the middle of the ocean.</l>
<l n="c">How attractively it rose up,</l>
<l n="d">A target for the veiling mist that enshrouded it so delightfully.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">A line of boats, their sails set, </l>
<l n="b">Dazzling white, seemed to beckon, </l>
<l n="c">Telling of the riches they bore, </l>
<l n="d">As they floated before the wind* on a voyage for treasure.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">Fishing boats* were everywhere, many far out in the middle of the ocean.</l>
<l n="b">Some, their decks at a precarious angle,* were being rowed.</l>
<l n="c">But others had overturned and, in distress, were being spun around and around</l>
<l n="d">By monstrous fish, as huge as mountains.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">The roaring ocean rumbled loudly</l>
<l n="b">As if to summon a poet to compose a poem,</l>
<l n="c">Gracefully billowing, as if in restless torment,</l>
<l n="d">To welcome Prince Pārtha joyfully.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="34">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">All he saw on his journey along the seashore was beautiful.</l>
<l n="b">Moreover, as the sun rode over the western mountain, it took his breath away.</l>
<l n="c">Rising clouds of spray from the salters working on the banks of the river mouth,</l>
<l n="d">Evaporated, merging into the ocean haze, like lovers in intimate* meeting.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">There were rice fields and plantations of cotton trees in landscaped gardens.</l>
<l n="b">As if uncertain of their charms, they presented the delights of their embankments to him.</l>
<l n="c">A multitude of <foreign>pasung*</foreign> milled together in welcome and flew in wave upon wave into the air,</l>
<l n="d">Leaving behind the crabs that stood so still they were hardly distinguishable in the roots of the <foreign>piḍaḍa</foreign> tree.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Herons flying homeward* side-by-side like strings of beads across the sky,</l>
<l n="b">Were seeking a place to roost, for it had now become gloomy and cold.</l>
<l n="c">The sunbeams had just begun to lose their splendour in the ocean mist,</l>
<l n="d">In a flaming, bright red-gleaming bank of wispy clouds, like showering sparks.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Then, from the inlets along the rocky coast in the distance, came the faint glow</l>
<l n="b">Of firelight that flared up with a burst of bright sparks.</l>
<l n="c">They looked like the reddened eyes* of a girl, languishing and forlorn, when overpowered on the couch,</l>
<l n="d">Or perhaps they were proclaiming that there was a village there, where travellers might spend a night by the shore.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">As the sun set, the trees shook visibly in the cold.</l>
<l n="b">Now they had cast off the veiling mist of the ocean, they seemed truly downcast.</l>
<l n="c">On the eighth day of the dark half of the moon, when, in the middle of the night, the moon came out displaying itself in its fullness,</l>
<l n="d">He went on his journey again, after spending several nights sojourning there.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">In Prabhasa, the prince came upon a flawless and pure river,</l>
<l n="b">Its mighty waters flowing pure and bright, renowned for their purificatory powers, the very water of life.</l>
<l n="c">This was the holy bathing place of the Yadu kingdom and none was more famous,</l>
<l n="d">For it was as peerless as the moonstone,* the source of the world’s creation.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">There the noble Dhanañjaya tarried a while and made his way along the banks.</l>
<l n="b">Delightedly following the course of the Prabhasa, he then journeyed westward.</l>
<l n="c">He was entranced by the sight of all its delights that so assuaged* his weary heart,</l>
<l n="d">And ever welcomed him as he passed by, hoping he would linger.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Truly flawless was the river’s array, quite extraordinary its delights.</l>
<l n="b">Many fallen and faded flowers,* left by those who came there to pray, had been abandoned there on the waves.</l>
<l n="c">Because of the unguents and saffron mixed together, it was always fragrant</l>
<l n="d">And members of the court came there daily, to bathe joyfully.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Indeed, its splendid snake-rock eclipsed the coral reefs of the ocean.</l>
<l n="b">One rock completely covered by roots, looked like an elephant with a trunk.*</l>
<l n="c">All who roamed about in pursuit of beauty, carried away on the tide of passion, made their way there,</l>
<l n="d">And it was ever the destination of lovers, planning a secret rendezvous, stealing away quietly together to its banks.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">On either side, pandanus blossomed delightfully along the banks.</l>
<l n="b">Beautiful to behold were the trailing flowers, some with petals half opened.</l>
<l n="c">When the bees sought them out, ensnared* by their fragrant pollen,</l>
<l n="d">They, like maidens overcome by heat,* were deflowered by them at will.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">No more will be said about the prince. Instead we will tell of Lord Kṛṣṇa.</l>
<l n="b">On hearing that Pārtha, most excellent of princes, was there, he was delighted,</l>
<l n="c">And immediately commanded the noble Sāmba to go and invite the son of Pāṇḍu to visit.</l>
<l n="d">The Yadu warriors, mounted on horses, elephants and chariots, a strong guard attending them, provided the escort.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">On his arrival, Sāmba approached the son of Pāṇḍu to greet him warmly,</l>
<l n="b">Saying, ‘Indeed, His Majesty invites you to come* to his court.</l>
<l n="c">Oh how happy is Kṛṣṇa and how delighted Baladewa too,</l>
<l n="d">Not to mention the entire Yadu tribe, all are overjoyed to hear [news] of you.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a"> ‘The king is presently on Mount Raiwata’s peak*</l>
<l n="b">Performing ceremonies in honour of Wiṣṇu,* holding a great feast and carrying out the royal rites.</l>
<l n="c">Not a single Yadu has stayed behind at home, all are there, performing sacrifices and every ritual prescribed.</l>
<l n="d">Thus may you bear patiently with him that he is not in his palace.’</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="35">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Thus the excellent, noble Sāmba addressed him respectfully. Dhanañjaya accepted,</l>
<l n="b">And they set out together, mounted in a chariot with all the Yadu hosts in attendance.</l>
<l n="c">Carefree and handsome were those who escorted them, all magnificent,</l>
<l n="d">And so the excellent Phalguṇa made his way to the mountain called Raiwata[ka].</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">We will tell of the restlessness of the women throughout the land who, like flower-buds awaiting the sound of thunder,</l>
<l n="b">Had just now heard news of the prince’s arrival, that was to them like the harbinger of the fourth month.</l>
<l n="c">The concealed desire of these jewel-like women of the inner court suddenly blossomed forth and now showed outwardly.</l>
<l n="d">They did not know what to do, and unable to escape from their yearning, unable to forget what they had heard, were struck down by love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Smitten by the new arrival, some plotted to ready their sweetness [for him].</l>
<l n="b">Others talked together, discussing him in soft whispers.</l>
<l n="c">So deeply* affected, cut to the very core of their being were they, that the mere mention of him aroused their desire,</l>
<l n="d">And they wanted to spread* a mat of flowers from their hair-knots before him, as a token* of their love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">There were some who were so love-sick they thought only of love-making, their thoughts directed to him alone.</l>
<l n="b">Swooning, they longed fervently for his words of love to assuage the pain of their desire and bewilderment.</l>
<l n="c">So eager were they, they cast their beautiful bodies on the ground, that the sweetness of his glance might fall on them as rain,</l>
<l n="d">Heedless of the pain if it should pierce them through, happy to face the dangers of defeat at his hands.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">It would take too long to recount the thoughts of the court ladies, suffering from love pangs.</l>
<l n="b">Pārtha then reached King Harimūrti, there at the meeting place where the Yadu tribe had gathered.</l>
<l n="c">Foremost amongst them was Lord Baladewa. All were drawn up in formation, in the middle of the arena,</l>
<l n="d">A place of perfect brilliance because of the splendour of the god-like Yadus.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Arjuna’s arrival filled Kṛṣṇa’s heart with such elation</l>
<l n="b">That he welcomed him accordingly with heart-warming smiles and kindly words:</l>
<l n="c">‘Dear brother, I can hardly believe that I may now come face to face with your world-conquering glory.</l>
<l n="d">Receive this throne my dear brother, that I have laid ready for you in your absence.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">‘For some time I have kept watch over you, my dear, and have come to hear of your deeds as you have striven,</l>
<l n="b">To dwell continuously on the Hima mountain. How fortunate that we now should meet.</l>
<l n="c">The gods decree: “Remember also the difficulties of those who know pleasure and are not afflicted with calamity.”*</l>
<l n="d">Stay here in Dwārawatī, let it be your temporary home until the appointed time elapses and you can again return home.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Thus said Lord Kṛṣṇa. The prince bowed low at his feet:</l>
<l n="b">‘If it please you,* Your Majesty, in truth it is you who are truly the foremost bestower of favours. Hail to you,* O righteous one!’</l>
<l n="c">This he said. In turn Halāyudha said respectfully to him:</l>
<l n="d">‘O my dear brother, indeed all the Yadus have certainly long awaited you.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">‘Your presence, my brother, will ensure that the rites which the Yadus now perform, will accomplish their aim perfectly.</l>
<l n="b">Please agree to take part so that through your participation, the welfare of the world will be assured.*</l>
<l n="c">By this alone can our journey be considered complete and enable us to return to the palace.</l>
<l n="d">Indeed, I will then accompany you home, my brother, as indeed will Kṛṣṇa.’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">Having spoken thus, Baladewa’s words were endorsed by the Yadu tribe.</l>
<l n="b">And treated thus, the prince’s heart blossomed like a lotus at the urging of gentle rain:</l>
<l n="c">‘Truly your words are fitting. May I, Your Majesty’s servant, continue to receive the special favour I have obtained!</l>
<l n="d">Indeed in your protection may I find the means by which my quest for virtue may succeed!’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">The Yadus were all happy to agree, none was averse to Arjuna’s presence,</l>
<l n="b">And welcomed the prince, as a guest, in every way he deserved.</l>
<l n="c">It would take too long to tell of this. Shortly after, as the sun set, the eighth hour* rang out.</l>
<l n="d">The radiant glow of the clouds, coloured brightly with beams of light like golden ornaments, gave way to night.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">Lord Kṛṣṇa withdrew to his quarters, in company with the prince who loved him so.</l>
<l n="b">Their spirits were as one, their affection deep and so they moved off to his private suite there in the camp.</l>
<l n="c">Shortly afterwards peace descended on all the Yadu tribe and on Dhanañjaya.</l>
<l n="d">‘It is just as the mist reaches the waters of the ocean,’ he thought.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">Let us say no more of the kings but tell now of the palace ladies.</l>
<l n="b">They were teased by longing now that the waning moon had altered the appearance of the night.</l>
<l n="c">The stars moved away to hide, just as a distressed girl, with side-long glances, turns her face away.</l>
<l n="d">Geese in flight, distant specks in the sky, that seemed to be eloping together, came to alight on a beautiful pond.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">Abandoned, despondent and melancholy, the bees waited in their holes, distressed now that they had been robbed of their desire,</l>
<l n="b">For the lotuses were no longer open. How cruel their actions,* for they were almost full-grown.</l>
<l n="c">Mournfully, the cuckoos lamented that the moon had not yet come to succour them in their love-sickness that evening,</l>
<l n="d">Forlorn and trembling because it was the ninth day of the dark half-month and the moon had not yet risen.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15"><l n="a">Moreover, the distant thunder seemed to summon whispered verses close to their ears.</l>
<l n="b">The sighing breeze bearing sweet fragrance to them was like the secret messenger of one waiting to elope.</l>
<l n="c">Suddenly the moon shone down brightly, to reveal itself in its full glory, as it rose high over the mountain peak,</l>
<l n="d">As if delighted to look down on the beauty of the women, happily applying powder* in the inner court.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="16"><l n="a">How lovely they were as they adorned their hair-knots with <foreign>aśoka</foreign> and <foreign>sumanasa</foreign> flowers, happily putting on their ornaments.</l>
<l n="b">As they chatted together in the light of the moon, some were plaiting combs in their hair.</l>
<l n="c">Merely to speak of the pursuit of pleasure and the enjoyment of beauty, filled them with desire,</l>
<l n="d">And because of their unrestrained longing and their sweetness, the very sight of the moon swept them away with passion.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="17"><l n="a">These beautiful women were skilled at expressing a poet’s passionate love in allusions.</l>
<l n="b">It was only right that maidens so fair should not seek to hide the charm of their <foreign>salukat</foreign> playing in singing <foreign>kidung</foreign>.</l>
<l n="c">Because their skills were renowned throughout the land it seemed to enhance their sweetness as they accompanied themselves on the <foreign>kangsi</foreign>.</l>
<l n="d">And not only that, for in their lute playing, the beauty of the ocean of honey* came surging forth.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="18"><l n="a">The women enhanced their charm and beauty by all having mastered thoroughly the art of poetry,</l>
<l n="b">Their recitations became even more captivating, as the strummed lute accompanied* those sweet-voiced singers.</l>
<l n="c">Their playing seemed to be stolen liquid syrup and melted honey from a broken dish,*</l>
<l n="d">Mixed with moonbeams, so that their <foreign>gamĕlan</foreign> playing caused utter enchantment.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="19"><l n="a">Others, filled with love, were talking quietly in sweet discussion.</l>
<l n="b">Such easy prey for the God of Love were they, that their hearts were the target of passionate desires.</l>
<l n="c">Her feelings of love leaving her weak,* one girl went to lie down with a <foreign>kakawin</foreign> scribbled on a pandanus leaf.</l>
<l n="d">As she read her poem aloud by the light of the moon, she was so painfully affected that in trying to keep secret* her longing, she fainted away.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="36">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Yet the one who held sway over the subtle form of fragrant beauty, a goddess of letters in human form,</l>
<l n="b">Was Subhadrā, the younger sister of Baladewa, now the fairest of maidens.</l>
<l n="c">Indeed the beauty of this precious jewel of the palace was so renowned</l>
<l n="d">That the very incarnation of liquid honey would return to seek help from her charms.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The lovely women who lived in the royal palace were enchanting as they disported in the moonlight.</l>
<l n="b">With a deluge of charm, as they skilfully sang songs containing allusions and played <foreign>gamĕlan</foreign>, they were indeed as beautiful as heavenly women.</l>
<l n="c">For the princess alone, they always composed with great devotion, songs</l>
<l n="d">That were as lively and charming as the ocean overflowing with the rains of the fourth month.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Without doubt, these court maidens were truly possessed of the greatest sweetness,</l>
<l n="b">But the charms of the princess were without peer, she alone held beauty.</l>
<l n="c">Just as the alluring lotus, opening up, reflects the glow of moonbeams,</l>
<l n="d">Her beauty was enhanced by her adornments and all who gazed upon it seemed to lose themselves in rapture.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">At the fourth stroke of midnight, the lovely women were still happily disporting there,</l>
<l n="b">But the princess, lulled by their <foreign>gamĕlan</foreign> playing, had become sleepy.</l>
<l n="c">A couch was arranged for her beneath a fragrant spreading <foreign>wungū</foreign> tree,</l>
<l n="d">Beautifully entwined with the shoots of the cinnamon tree and strewn on all sides was fragrant* jasmine.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">There the princess, as beautiful as the Goddess of Love, Ratih, rested on the bed.</l>
<l n="b">Soothed by her beautiful surroundings, sleepiness crept over her and entered unseen into her heart.</l>
<l n="c">Blown about constantly by the wind, the boughs fluttered in the breeze, like waving fans.</l>
<l n="d">Soothingly and affectionately* the bees in their holes called out gently.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The delightful murmuring of the <foreign>garantung</foreign> bamboo xylophones delightfully vied, in unbroken rhythm, with the thunder.</l>
<l n="b">Lovely and sweet was the music of the lutes as the women gracefully and languidly sang the introductory melody,</l>
<l n="c">As if to soothe and sing a lullaby to their lady, who slept there absorbed in dreams,</l>
<l n="d">For all the world like an offering of a maiden,* resting on a couch, inspiring devotion.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="37">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The enchantment of the night permeated everywhere.</l>
<l n="b">Moreover, the distant splashing of a waterfall could be heard unceasingly.</l>
<l n="c">The hammering of bark* suddenly sounded out and seemed to inspire feelings of longing,</l>
<l n="d">As its relentless, incessant beat urged lovers to elope.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Thunder rumbled softly like a lover’s sweet whispers,</l>
<l n="b">To make the buds of the flowers of the <foreign>unĕng</foreign> creeper* split open and display themselves in their fullness.</l>
<l n="c">The areca palm blossoms unfurled to wound the hearts of the love-lorn mercilessly,</l>
<l n="d">The <foreign>asanas,</foreign> buffeted by the wind, spread their fragrant perfume on the breeze.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Such was the beauty and charm that it would fain set hearts atremble.</l>
<l n="b">Pārtha was not yet asleep for he was completely captivated.</l>
<l n="c">A breath of wind passing by brought him its cool freshness.</l>
<l n="d">He could hear the <foreign>walik</foreign> calling, its lament made him smile.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Night passed and as day dawned, the world donned fresh clothing,</l>
<l n="b">As the <foreign>asanas</foreign> in the borders of the delightful hermitage opened.</l>
<l n="c">The sun whirled, spinning around in the water of the sea, </l>
<l n="d">Its golden rays shining brightly to dye the heavens in red light.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Birds twittered* in the branches, merrily calling out* to each other for joy of the day.</l>
<l n="b">Swarming bees buzzed backwards and forwards, resting on one flower* after another, like husbands* going from wife to wife.</l>
<l n="c">When it became light, the son of Pāṇḍu bathed and purified himself</l>
<l n="d">Before invoking the sun with the recitation of mantras and the prescribed rites.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Assiduously, he sought the object of his prayers.</l>
<l n="b">His heart ever turned to the gods as he performed his worship.</l>
<l n="c">So too, Lord Kṛṣṇa devoted himself to reciting the mantras of kingship,</l>
<l n="d">Unfailingly striving for tranquillity, and, having adorned himself, was even more resplendent.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">When they had both completed their ritual washing and recited their prayers,</l>
<l n="b">They came out together, standing ready there at the gateway.</l>
<l n="c">Their garments gleaming brightly shone like the newly-risen sun.</l>
<l n="d">Together, they were as resplendent as the sun riding on the highest point of the eastern mountain.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">The Yadus were already assembled, their vassals all stood ready.</l>
<l n="b">Haladhara was bedecked with gleaming jewels.</l>
<l n="c">Incomparable was he, clearly a hero of immense presence.</l>
<l n="d">All the Wṛṣṇis and Andhakas stood together in rows in close formation.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Then they set out immediately, and came at last to the sanctuary,*</l>
<l n="b">Where all was faultlessly arranged, in great splendour.</l>
<l n="c">Standards fluttered gracefully on high,* a glittering mass,*</l>
<l n="d">Pennants swayed and pennons sparkled.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">As the Yadu troops noisily bustled about their tasks there in the hermitage, they filled it completely.</l>
<l n="b">The melodies, sounding out unceasingly,* were taken up* by the many singers.</l>
<l n="c">Then, filling every direction, - north, south, east and west, - with their sound,</l>
<l n="d">Drums banged and gongs and <foreign>roñji</foreign>* answered each other.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">The commotion of so many Wṛṣṇis and Yadus became more and more tumultuous.</l>
<l n="b">They looked like an ocean of blossoming flowers in their brilliant festival attire, </l>
<l n="c">And it was especially the lovely women who created this beautiful scene,</l>
<l n="d">With the movement of their shapely eyebrows as sharp as slivers of gravel.*</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="38">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The Yadu hosts added their increasing lustre to the radiance of the temple.</l>
<l n="b">It was as divine in appearance as the abode of the gods and its shrines were all-surpassing.</l>
<l n="c"> Exquisite cloths - <foreign>dukūla, manitra</foreign> and <foreign>kairatila* </foreign>- all decoratively arranged, were draped everywhere,</l>
<l n="d">And, as if by magic, the garlands of <foreign>cawĕli</foreign> silk seemed to be aflame.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Songs of praise* rang out and many different bells tinkled like buzzing bees circling beautiful flowers.</l>
<l n="b">All was enriched by the blaring of conches, vying with the resounding <foreign>gubar</foreign> gongs,</l>
<l n="c">As the chief priests softly and clearly recited prayers together,</l>
<l n="d">For the prosperity of the kingdom, that it might be without conflict* and all evil-doers vanquished.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">After paying homage to the deities, the kings performed the flower-offering ceremonies at the shrine of Widhi.* </l>
<l n="b">The Yadus also all performed flower worship to Wiṣṇu, truly concentrating their thoughts upon him,*</l>
<l n="c">As he now descended to the most exquisite, golden pavilion,* for he was their paramount protector,</l>
<l n="d">Renowned on earth as the cause of the king’s most famous deeds.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The festivities then took place, arranged with all-surpassing magnificence.</l>
<l n="b">Elated, the Yadus joined together in mock-combat, and moved into the attack, resplendently.*</l>
<l n="c">All who took part were skilled in the use of shields and in wielding javelins and hatchets.</l>
<l n="d">Their gleaming armour seemed ablaze as wave after wave attacked, becoming ever more dazzling.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Some looked their opponents defiantly in the eye. All were masters at alternately pushing forward then dodging skilfully.</l>
<l n="b">Standing upright together they exchanged lusty shouts,* for they had been well trained in the ways of battle.</l>
<l n="c">In their splendour, they were worthy bearers* of the gleaming jackets of honour and sparkling arm-bands.*</l>
<l n="d">The violence of their clashing drowned out* the constant roar of thundering <foreign>gubar</foreign> and <foreign>paḍahi</foreign> drums.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The decorations worn by those wild with drink were resplendent: their gleaming mail shone all the more fiercely.</l>
<l n="b">Their breasts all aglow from their clothes, some wore bright shining collars.</l>
<l n="c">With their arms stretched sideways, they took no notice of the actions of those who shouted at them.</l>
<l n="d">The attendants asked to bring them drinks of welcome, stopped, embarrassed by their jabbering.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">The spectators, the young gentlewomen and the children of the nobles who were famous for their goodness and refined manners,</l>
<l n="b">Though amused to see this, covered their lips with their hands demurely.*</l>
<l n="c">Truly enchanting were the brief glimpses of their sideways glances as they opened and closed their mouths in sweet laughter,</l>
<l n="d">And it seemed the gathering place of honey would be eclipsed by their open lips, fresh and red.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">But we will not tell of them as, at sunset, it all came to an end.</l>
<l n="b">A great feast was then held by all the Yadus, in the centre of the arena.*</l>
<l n="c">Laid out in readiness were all the delicious produce of mountain, forest and sea,</l>
<l n="d">Which they ate with relish, their enjoyment enhanced by the entertainment offered by the musicians.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Because it had been arranged by the kings, Kṛṣṇa, Pārtha, Baladewa and Ugrasena,</l>
<l n="b">There seemed to be a thundering mountain torrent* of meat, drink and other delicacies.</l>
<l n="c">The kings had catered for every conceivable taste,</l>
<l n="d">And all became more and more intoxicated, overwhelmed with drinks of fermented spirits* and rum.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="39">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Thus was the form of the worship they performed,* most prominent amongst them* all the Wṛṣṇi heroes.</l>
<l n="b">But we will not tell of this. After they had finished eating, all had been made content by the king’s bounty,</l>
<l n="c">Not to mention the Wṛṣṇi troops who were replete with food and drink.</l>
<l n="d">Becoming ever more joyful and merry, they took their leisure and caroused in their quarters.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">In the cool of the evening Baladewa went off in search of beauty.</l>
<l n="b">Lord Kṛṣṇa following behind, they set off from the royal quarters.</l>
<l n="c">With Pārtha at his side, riding with him in the same chariot,</l>
<l n="d">Clearly they were indeed, as splendid as Wiṣṇu* and the God of Love, both irresistible in form.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The valiant Wṛṣṇis and Andhakas also went off to seek out different pleasures,* each according to their desire.</l>
<l n="b">There were some who headed for the hermitage to reflect on the beauty of the banks of the river* and deep craggy gullies.</l>
<l n="c">Others went to secluded parts of the forest, in search of a place to be alone and gaze out over the distant ocean,</l>
<l n="d">While others went hunting, gaily cooking and eating [their catch in] a floating water-pavilion.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Even more magnificent was the princess as she departed,* indeed, she was a painting come to life.</l>
<l n="b">Riding in a chariot on a throne of gold, she was as beautiful as the embodiment of all the deities of the month of spring,</l>
<l n="c">Displaying charms that seemed to come forth from the realm of dreams to thrust aside all other sensory delights.</l>
<l n="d">Her escort of warriors, standing fully-equipped on either side, was as resplendent as a foot-guard of gods. </l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">The ladies of the court were like flower buds opening up, their joyful hearts full of high spirits.</l>
<l n="b">Their attendants and handmaidens competed with each other to gather the largest bunches of blossoming flowers.</l>
<l n="c">Many rode in covered palanquins of gold, others in black ones with golden parasols,</l>
<l n="d">Which looked like bees in search of flowers, their colours muted* by a misty veil of fragrant, unfurling pandanus.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">As if to restrain their tendrils from longing* to capture the hearts of the people passing by,</l>
<l n="b">The supple creepers, newly unfurling, languidly hung down, limp with desire.</l>
<l n="c">Lovingly, the lovely <foreign>sanggākaśa</foreign> creeper seemed to embrace the beautiful clusters of blossoms, filled with passion.</l>
<l n="d">Moreover so thick were its tendrils that the area around was cast in shadow and gave forth fragrance to accompany them.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Like an aigrette of gold, the <foreign>karṇnikāra</foreign>, displaying the charm of its blossom for the first time, was radiant.</l>
<l n="b">Its young leaves* moved restlessly, stretching out in all directions as if they had no desire for the fragrant <foreign>gaḍung.</foreign></l>
<l n="c">They seemed to sway continuously, shying away from the embrace of the young shoots growing along the ground.</l>
<l n="d">Dallying there was a wood-cock, flapping his wings, with his wife below, his constant companion.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Then the trees rustling with expectant pleasure* in the soft breeze</l>
<l n="b">That brings with it the rain of the fourth month, were delighted to be visited by such beautiful love-sick maidens, and invited them to come near.</l>
<l n="c">The mango and mangosteen, <foreign>rambutan</foreign>, <foreign>wadara</foreign>,* <foreign>wuni</foreign>, and <foreign>paḍali</foreign> were heavily laden, their flowers and fruits all laid ready for them, </l>
<l n="d">And the maids, gathering the fruits of the trees along the many paths, were delightful.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">As they picnicked there, how enchanting they were. The astounding sight of such extraordinary beauty was sure to quicken the pulse,</l>
<l n="b">For, in great delight, they had lifted their hems as they sought pleasure, enhancing their loveliness still more,</l>
<l n="c">Exposing their slender calves, that, as they peeped from underneath their <foreign>kains</foreign>, were like ivory pandanus flowers.</l>
<l n="d">It was only fitting that the sight of them would make the desire and passion of any lover catch in his throat,* overpower and destroy him.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">The forest, carpeted with flowers, rivalled the design of a palace, its blooms drawn up in floral battle formations everywhere.</l>
<l n="b">The women were the female warriors* attacking them together, inevitably destroying them as they seized them.</l>
<l n="c">Indeed they were lions in battle, like bees thrusting eagerly, wanting only to be one* with the fragrant flowers.</l>
<l n="d">And so they all joined in laying waste the flowers,* carrying them off by force, plucking them all without pause.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">There were many whose thoughts had turned to love-making and, without further ado, they ornamented their beauty as they walked along.</l>
<l n="b">Wholly unconstrained, they arranged tendrils of the <foreign>aśoka</foreign> as love-tokens* in their hair, the pollen enveloping them in its fragrance.</l>
<l n="c"><foreign>Śridanta</foreign> and <foreign>wungu</foreign> were the ornaments they used as sashes and necklaces delightfully adorning themselves.</l>
<l n="d">One could only surmise that in their beauty was the alluring sweetness of a sister to love* seeking out pleasure.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="40">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">We will tell of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Pārtha,</l>
<l n="b">As in leisurely manner, they made their way along the mountain ridge,</l>
<l n="c">Looking down on the beauty of the hill below,</l>
<l n="d">Its charms clearly lying ready to view.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Pure, sparkling waters splashed down over the ravine,</l>
<l n="b">The many streams forming a pond of great beauty.</l>
<l n="c">The glistening water plants thus bespattered</l>
<l n="d">Were indeed like a treasure trove of countless jewels and gems there.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Another crystal-clear brook spilled down the hill.</l>
<l n="b">A waterfall could be distinctly heard tumbling straight down into the ravine.</l>
<l n="c">There in the deep gully it roared like thunder,</l>
<l n="d">Resounding more loudly than the <foreign>gubar</foreign> and <foreign>gĕṇḍing</foreign> drums at the great festival.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Moreover its sparkling, glinting droplets</l>
<l n="b">Were scattered and strewn about on every side,</l>
<l n="c">As if to bid them welcome with reverential salutations </l>
<l n="d">Constantly* paying them homage, or so they thought.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Lord Arjuna was delighted when he saw</l>
<l n="b">How the mountain seemed to hold itself in readiness.</l>
<l n="c">Peacocks crowed on the hills along the mountain ridges</l>
<l n="d">And the <foreign>kamanak</foreign>* together answered each other.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The soft buzzing of bees, charmingly lost in contemplation of beautiful flowers,</l>
<l n="b">Could be heard all along the path, </l>
<l n="c">Sipping nectar like priests</l>
<l n="d">Conferring blessings of praise on the two of them as they passed.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Moreover, the casuarinas blowing about in the wind, rustled,</l>
<l n="b">Whispering gently as if to attract their attention.</l>
<l n="c">Faintly, softly, the turtle doves provided the accompaniment</l>
<l n="d">In counterpoint to the melodious voices of the <foreign>pakṣi kĕtur</foreign> birds.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">The shoots of the <foreign>wĕlas-hyun</foreign> creeper were beautifully intertwined*</l>
<l n="b">With the fragrant palms,* quite inseparable.</l>
<l n="c">The widely spread branches of the trees hung low,</l>
<l n="d">And the water lilies, from kindness, seemed to keep them afloat.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Moreover, there was over-hanging <foreign>prabhu sanmata</foreign> there, </l>
<l n="b">With its creepers unfurling on all sides to screen* the thickets.</l>
<l n="c">Charmingly showing itself in its full richness, the ripened <foreign>wuni</foreign> </l>
<l n="d">Skilfully split its sharp blackened points into four.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">Mount Raiwata[ka] was truly beautiful</l>
<l n="b">And Janārdana spoke of it thus:</l>
<l n="c">‘Here is the fixed abode* of God Wiṣṇu,</l>
<l n="d">None other than the place of refuge of the people of Dwārawatī.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">‘The Yadus therefore always strive</l>
<l n="b">To ensure that proper worship flourishes and respectfully pay homage here,</l>
<l n="c">Sedulously intent on their aim of furthering the welfare of the realm,</l>
<l n="d">And from its protection comes its certain prosperity.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">Thus said Kṛṣṇa to Dhanañjaya,</l>
<l n="b">Filling the prince’s heart with strength.</l>
<l n="c">Therefore he set off happily</l>
<l n="d">Along the winding valley path through the ravine.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">The dense bamboo that lined the narrow path,</l>
<l n="b">Was shaken and bent back by the gentle breeze.</l>
<l n="c">The plants had deliberately opened up to expose their centres</l>
<l n="d">And when they were pushed over, they seemed to sink down with a rustle.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">Steep slopes and precipices came right up to the verges. </l>
<l n="b"><foreign>Gĕsing</foreign> and <foreign>pĕtung</foreign> bamboos rose up side by side,</l>
<l n="c">Sheaths unfurled to expose their half-closed eyes, blinking</l>
<l n="d">Their scratchy shoots,* all ready for the attack.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15"><l n="a">It would take too long to tell of them passing by the thickets.</l>
<l n="b">With each step they encountered beauty.</l>
<l n="c">As they gazed up at the mountain, its splendour seemed magical,</l>
<l n="d">Its charm as a pleasure spot quite unsurpassed.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="41">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">They could see the women of the inner court enjoying the scenery there, all as beautiful as figures in a painting.</l>
<l n="b">As they delightfully cut flower-sprays, displaying their charms anew,* how resplendent they were.</l>
<l n="c">They looked like sculpted diamonds as they abandoned themselves to the pursuit of pleasure all joyfully disporting, themselves,</l>
<l n="d">Their charms those of the Goddess of Beauty herself, newly emerging in bodily form from a profusion of flowers.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">A garden of beautiful women were they, akin to <foreign>asana</foreign> flowers that have just come to intimate union* with the river.</l>
<l n="b">Some were adorning themselves, looking at their reflections in the water whilst arranging their hair-knots with bouquets of flowers.</l>
<l n="c">Others dangled their legs in the water to cool themselves, as if to avoid* the gushing torrent,</l>
<l n="d">Attractively exposing their slender waists, fit to pierce the <foreign>kangsi</foreign>* of the God of Love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">These beautiful ladies were like a painting come to life, their glances, when they looked sideways, sweet enough</l>
<l n="b">To cause intense love-pangs and burning desire. Their hair bands were as perfect and smooth as dark clouds.</l>
<l n="c">Their graceful limbs were bedecked with armlets and garlands made from <foreign>asana</foreign> flowers and <foreign>wĕlas-harĕp</foreign> creepers,</l>
<l n="d">Like a collection of beauty created by the God of Love, glimpsed for but a moment of passion, by a poet.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">One girl, lost in rapt contemplation of* the far ocean, would awaken feelings of love</l>
<l n="b">As if, at the decree of the Muse, her loveliness was not of this world, but must merge into the letters [of a poem].</l>
<l n="c">Unperturbed as her waist broke free of the embrace of its bands, and suddenly loosened,</l>
<l n="d">To expose [her breasts] like ivory coconuts a little, she was enough to inundate* even the senses of an ascetic who has already attained detachment.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Another there was whose refined beauty was so like that of the <foreign>campaka</foreign> flower that it was only proper she be reserved for the God of Love.</l>
<l n="b">As she held on her lap a pandanus flower, her calves seemed driven to expose themselves as if they were the reason for the rain.</l>
<l n="c">How beautiful she was as she wrote on the doll of petals cradled in her lap, inscribing it with her sharp nails,*</l>
<l n="d">Sitting restfully leaning on one arm on the rock, then turning her attention to the beauties of nature in the stream in the gully.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Yet another rested charmingly on a couch of rock as she pictured in her mind the petal-doll coming to life.*</l>
<l n="b">Fragrant leaves and jasmine were her mattress as she sat absorbed in the vastness* of the beautiful sky.</l>
<l n="c">Her skin was golden, her uncovered waist as supple as the new shoots of the <foreign>aśoka,</foreign></l>
<l n="d">Which would clearly wither, if she were approached on that couch by an ardent lover.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">The beautiful female attendants transported beauty there, as they amused themselves, their charms surpassing* those of flower buds.</l>
<l n="b">Exuberantly they sought sweet delight. All had been blessed with figures of such beauty that they were fitting to be the object of longing.</l>
<l n="c">Joyously the young girls, wearing beautiful wreaths of <foreign>wungū</foreign> flowers, picked flowers and shoots,</l>
<l n="d">Their youthful sweetness giving them a special radiance as they moved about. </l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">They seemed never to tire of seeking out the beauties of nature, spreading out* the fragrant <foreign>asanas</foreign> and jasmine.</l>
<l n="b">They wove blossoming <foreign>tañjung</foreign> and lovely <foreign>priyaka</foreign> into garlands and used them straight away as pins in their hair-knots.</l>
<l n="c">Their ear ornaments were young <foreign>tarawarṣa</foreign> creepers,* their hair secured with clasps of <foreign>gaḍung</foreign> shoots,*</l>
<l n="d">The fragrant pollen which fell on their beautiful breasts, they used as powder, its perfumes wafting overall.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Although the many beautiful women there could be depicted as incarnations of Beauty,</l>
<l n="b">They were clearly no match for the sweet beauty of her whose loveliness outshone* all at court.</l>
<l n="c">Instead, if they entered her presence, the charms of these other jewels of the palace seemed to become useless and falter.</l>
<l n="d">In short, Subhadrā was the essence of beauty* and the incarnation of every delight of the ocean of honey.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">Now Nature had fashioned a bower that was as beautiful as a painting.</l>
<l n="b">Carved of coral, beautifully hung with curtains of <foreign>wĕlas-harĕp</foreign> creeper, gracefully it displayed its charms.</l>
<l n="c">Forming a magnificent wall along each side, <foreign>jangga</foreign> vines unfurled towards the sugar palms.</l>
<l n="d">As they reached out, shaken continually by the wind, their wafted fragrance pervaded overall.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">From there, she took pleasure in watching her maids who had mastered thoroughly the art of beautiful songs.</l>
<l n="b">She was like a beautiful statue, lost in thought, and they came to her to present her with fragrant pandanus<foreign>.</foreign></l>
<l n="c">Such was her due and, undoubtedly, she alone was the most exalted jewel of the court.</l>
<l n="d">How else could she be thought of than as the beauty of molten honey in visible form?</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">Truly, she was the origin* of bounteous beauty, the jewel of loveliness, the soul of the whole world.</l>
<l n="b">Confused, the bees in the pandanus followed after her, carried away by longing, unable to resist caressing her feet.</l>
<l n="c">Those devoted* to her care could not fail to be thrown into confusion at the sight of her resting there on the elephant rock.</l>
<l n="d">Any who caught even a glimpse of her would think that she was the goddess of beauty, returning to her immaterial state.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">How could the beauty of the seeds of the <foreign>sumanasa</foreign>* or the blossoming pandanus not be defeated and annihilated?</l>
<l n="b">How could even the most skilfully written <foreign>kakawin</foreign> possibly have within its orbit the words to depict* her?</l>
<l n="c">The sharp point of the stylus of a poet composing verse would snap,* unable to go on, greatly distressed and without purpose,</l>
<l n="d">Because in the face of her beauty, the subtle words on the writing board would cease, their blackness would simply vanish.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14"><l n="a">The delights of the sea-shore would be destroyed, so awe-stricken at being thus rejected,* that they would leave without a backward glance.</l>
<l n="b">The mountains would crumble, not daring to breathe, no longer able to elicit rapturous wonder because of her.</l>
<l n="c">Taken by surprise, the beauty of the sky, even if it could be captured,* would certainly have no effect and would pine away,</l>
<l n="d">While the charms of a beautiful garden would disappear, even though it would wrongly cause sorrow.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="42">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Pārtha came there together with Kṛṣṇa,</l>
<l n="b">Their hearts filled with joy at seeing the beauty of the wooded hills.</l>
<l n="c">All at once Pārtha was overcome with sharp longing.</l>
<l n="d">Thoughts of the princess filled his mind, throwing him into utter confusion.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Therefore the prince questioned the king:</l>
<l n="b">‘That girl there, Subhadrā, who is known to be the most outstanding of princesses,</l>
<l n="c">Goddess of all enchanting beauty, </l>
<l n="d">The daughter of king Basudewa, is a jewel amongst maidens.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">‘Truly, on all this earth she has no equal.</l>
<l n="b">How could any passionate man* be indifferent to her or unaffected by her?</l>
<l n="c">Beauty* should be the only goal of a passionate man.</l>
<l n="d">Gold and superb jewels would easily be a fitting price for it.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Thus he said. Kṛṣṇa replied:</l>
<l n="b">‘O indeed you are mistaken in what you say, my brother.</l>
<l n="c">Although my little sister is young and ripe for marriage,</l>
<l n="d">It is actually very difficult to find someone to match her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">‘Even though it is expected* that a <foreign>swayambara</foreign> be held,</l>
<l n="b">Only forcible abduction would suffice,</l>
<l n="c">For a truly valiant and mighty hero </l>
<l n="d">Who would dare to seize her, unafraid of my presence here.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">‘Perhaps such a one could win over my sister,</l>
<l n="b">And would not be afraid to resist the warriors of the line of Wṛṣṇi.’</l>
<l n="c">Thus said Janārdana with asperity,*</l>
<l n="d">As if inflamed with ire at the words of the son of Pāṇḍu.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">The noble Pārtha was indeed resolute and knew no fear:</l>
<l n="b">‘Were all of them able to lie in ambush, still I would crush them and destroy them all!’</l>
<l n="c">Thus he thought and rose to his feet crying:</l>
<l n="d">‘I am not afraid of you Yadus!’ and immediately strode forward.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Swiftly he seized the frightened princess,</l>
<l n="b">Who was dazed and shocked as he clasped her to his breast,</l>
<l n="c">And climbed into his chariot, holding her so tightly in his embrace, that, in her terror, she was powerless to resist.</l>
<l n="d">With that he carried her off, speeding quickly away.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Thereupon the Yadus were filled with dejection, </l>
<l n="b">All sadly oppressed, that he was not intimidated.</l>
<l n="c">Despondently reflecting on their uselessness,</l>
<l n="d">For so contemptible were they that they had just stayed their hand and allowed him to go.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="43">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">We will not tell of Arjuna but of the Wṛṣṇis who fled</l>
<l n="b">To bow down* before Lord Haladhara and give news of Pārtha’s deed.</l>
<l n="c">The king was then so filled with boiling, righteous rage, </l>
<l n="d">That sparks seem to fly from the reflected glare of his livid face.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">At once, in the heat of his blazing anger, he roared loudly:</l>
<l n="b">‘Shame upon you, O wicked, vile Pārtha! Believe that I will see that you are destroyed and swept away!’</l>
<l n="c">Thus said the king rising to his feet and seizing his great and powerful weapons,*</l>
<l n="d">Looking more and more as if he would destroy the world and overturn the ocean, Rudra’s fire* in visible form.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">All the princes and particularly the kings were equally angry and eager to do battle.</l>
<l n="b">Moreover, all were very fierce and in their frenzy stood upright, like lions filled with fighting spirit.</l>
<l n="c">Pradyumna and Gadā, Satyaka, Niśaṭha and Sāmba, vehement and savage.</l>
<l n="d">All possessed of tremendous great power, thorns in the side of any lion-like warrior were they.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">And the Wṛṣṇis, their valiant allies, were all celebrated for their skill,</l>
<l n="b">They too were indomitable champions, victorious in battle, skilful, resolute and famed.</l>
<l n="c">How could either advancing demon or monster not be pulverised?</l>
<l n="d">Such was the extent of their uncontrolled anger that they ground their teeth with pent-up rage, and shouted out noisily to each other.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">It seemed that Mount Raiwata[ka] would surely be destroyed: the small animals were thrown into great commotion by the blaring of war trumpets,</l>
<l n="b">The thundering of the kettle-drums and the crashing of cymbals* all sounding out together.</l>
<l n="c">Elephants trumpeted, horses neighed, shouts rang out,</l>
<l n="d">A kaleidoscope of multi-coloured standards rose on high, a dense mass of weapons glinting everywhere.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The hosts of warriors, with their entire forces, were fully equipped, all perfect in form.</l>
<l n="b">Valour lapped at their full hearts* like the ocean at the incoming tide.</l>
<l n="c">After being ordered into their respective divisions, they stood in formation to march out against Pārtha with all their might, </l>
<l n="d">All equally impatient, voraciously wishing to prove how eager and unafraid they were.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Brimful with ferocity, the Yadus were fearful to behold, all shouting loudly,</l>
<l n="b">With but a single thought: to hunt Pārtha down, leaving no stone unturned, and kill him.</l>
<l n="c">They took up their many bows and weapons in readiness,</l>
<l n="d">As frenzied as the Lord of Death in their great haste to attack furiously.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">With Haladhara’s departure, these heroes set out with a great roar. The troops advanced</l>
<l n="b">In serried ranks, in thundering, unbroken succession, as they tried to outpace each other,</l>
<l n="c">But as they came upon Lord Kṛṣṇa, who was quite unperturbed, they came to a halt,</l>
<l n="d">Lord Haladhara choking to see his brother, the king, like that.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">He stepped forward quickly towards Lord Kṛṣṇa saying:</l>
<l n="b">‘O my brother! Fie! Do you mean to do nothing about Pārtha’s evil conduct!</l>
<l n="c">We can no longer regard him as a brother! It is not to be contemplated!</l>
<l n="d">In vain we have treated him with honour and entertained him regally.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">‘Indeed, I perceive his insult as so extreme that I am roused to anger by it.</l>
<l n="b">In truth, he is despicable! How can he act in such an evil, hostile, vile manner?</l>
<l n="c">Truly he knows not the meaning of respect as set down in the Law. He shows us nothing but scorn in abducting our sister.*</l>
<l n="d">Blind to proper conduct, treacherous, his insolence goes too far, he has insulted us beyond measure.’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">Thus he said harshly and Lord Kṛṣṇa answered him:</l>
<l n="b">‘O King such vehement talk avails you nothing!</l>
<l n="c">You are a hero,* a world-protector, your victories are worthy of praise that resounds throughout the three worlds.</l>

<l n="b">The Yadu hosts who had been sent to invite him to return, then came upon them,</l>

<l n="d">The whispering music of bamboo xylophones echoed, as if to proclaim the happiness of the whole kingdom.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="16"><l n="a">With his princess by his side, Dhanañjaya came forward</l>
<l n="b">And bowed low at the feet of both kings gathered there.</l>
<l n="c">At this, King Baladewa’s displeasure ceased, as he joyously received them warmly. </l>
<l n="d">Thus Kṛṣṇa’s noble teaching was brought to perfect fruition.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="17"><l n="a">After that, the kings dispatched a messenger to return to the palace compound,</l>

<l n="b">Many kinds of delicious food and drinks had been prepared and were set before him.</l>
<l n="c">The friendship of King Harimūrti as well was undiminished,</l>

</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="19"><l n="a">We will not tell of the time spent entertaining Pārtha.</l>
<l n="b">Night came and soon the whole kingdom slept.</l>

</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="20"><l n="a">The noble Pārtha and the princess were escorted</l>
<l n="b">There to Dwārawatī, where they were indeed* received kindly by His Majesty the King.</l>

<l n="b">All wanting to catch their first glimpse of this excellent prince of whom they had heard.</l>
<l n="c">Because they had never seen him before, they had come immediately, running outside in great haste.</l>
<l n="d">Young and old, even widows waited, some so decrepit with age they were bent over, but who, nevertheless, wanted to go too.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">In a flurry, they came running quickly there. Some shouted out aloud in their desire to be first,</l>
<l n="b">Pushing against each other, bumping together, others racing neck and neck, called out noisily to those who had not come to the great square.</l>
<l n="c">Heedless of their ornaments, many fought to be the first to catch sight of the prince,</l>
<l n="d">Others who had been adjusting their <foreign>kains</foreign> ran out, so anxious to fly there without delay, that they were left half-dressed.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Let us pass over the arrival of Dhanañjaya. The kings made their way towards the inner apartments.</l>
<l n="b">There, according to rank, they prostrated themselves at the feet of King Basudewa and his queen,</l>
<l n="c">Who swiftly and kindly accepted Dhanañjaya, for not only was he handsome but he was also a powerful hero, possessed of virtue and skill,</l>
<l n="d">Moreover, a fitting partner for the princess, for he was none other than her close relative.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The King spoke thus, ‘Oh my son, Pārtha, hear what I have to say to you.</l>
<l n="b">Truly, just as Harimūrti and Karṣana,* you too are my refuge.</l>
<l n="c">May it bring us prosperity, my son, to be united with you and to be of one purpose, without discord.*</l>
<l n="d">For we are the branches of one family. Do not forget that you too can be said to be of my own seed.’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">The words of the king were sincere and, like ambrosia, brought contentment to those who heard them.</l>
<l n="b">Moreover, they were truly worthy sentiments, for he was an ancient and wise king, versed in the esoteric doctrines and practices of the welfare of others.</l>
<l n="c">The prince thus addressed with words of honour, made an obeisance to acknowledge the felicity of the king’s words,</l>
<l n="d">Bringing great pleasure to the depths of the hearts of the hosts of soldiers who listened with delight to this praise.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="47">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">After they had discoursed thus, the most eminent officials were appointed</l>
<l n="b">To arrange all that was needed for the performance of the <foreign>piḍuḍukan</foreign> ceremonies* and wedding offerings,</l>
<l n="c">Because the most auspicious time for the princess to be united in marriage with Dhanañjaya</l>
<l n="d">Was the following day, and it was then that they would receive the king’s blessing.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">So* the entire Yadu tribe assembled there in complete formation and stood ready in the hall.</l>
<l n="b">The rank and file from throughout the land were there, drawn up in their various divisions, </l>
<l n="c">Ready to attend quickly to the king’s instructions,</l>
<l n="d">All firmly resolved to carry them out according to the prescriptions so that its splendour should be without flaw.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">And so all was arranged appropriately: the many offerings stood ready,</l>
<l n="b">Brought into being by the power of the king who was the supreme and excellent Wiṣṇu.</l>
<l n="c">Moreover, the buildings both inside and outside the palace,</l>
<l n="d">Were restored to their original perfect state, all richly and lavishly decorated.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The open hall, beautifully roofed with a canopy of lovely jewels, sparkled.</l>
<l n="b">Of equal splendour were the pillars carved with different designs.</l>
<l n="c">Moreover, the bamboo leaves that glittered along the gleaming fences </l>
<l n="d">Were painted with plant motifs* that looked like masked figures.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Even the ridges of the roof were exquisite, inlaid with patterns of precious stones.</l>
<l n="b">The galleries along the sides, surrounded by screens, were shaped like the fins of fishes.*</l>
<l n="c">Gleaming,* golden <foreign>jangga</foreign> vines* trailed delicately over the panels.</l>
<l n="d">Set with rubies, the <foreign>cawĕni</foreign> muslin had embroidered leaf-designs of shining embroidered silk.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The land now reverberated like the crashing ocean,</l>
<l n="b">As the music of the <foreign>mṛdangga</foreign> and <foreign>paḍahi</foreign> royal drums thundered out in unison,</l>
<l n="c">And the great celebrations and feasting that the Yadus held</l>
<l n="d">Were now directed towards the preparations for the marriage celebration* of the noble Phalguṇa.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">Ugrasena had arrived in the court-yard together with the other kings,</l>
<l n="b">Prominent amongst them was Harimūrti, their leader, and Halāyudha.</l>
<l n="c">As Prince Pārtha was regaled magnificently in the hall,</l>
<l n="d">All thought he surpassed even Surapati in splendour.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">There was a beautiful bower of love, of unrivalled magnificence,</l>
<l n="b">A creation of the God of Love himself, a building of diamonds, beautifully arranged for the pleasure of passionate lovers.</l>
<l n="c">Its roof was set with glittering, blue <foreign>śaśarudhira</foreign> gems and an orb of sparkling rubies.</l>
<l n="d">Its embroidered canopy was shaped like the moon and embroidered with* <foreign>cucur</foreign> birds.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">There was a balcony on the high ledge of the front verandah* of this pavilion.</l>
<l n="b">All the beauty of the Tāladhwaja* garden unfolding in the fourth month, had assembled there.</l>
<l n="c">Spread out were <foreign>kalpataru</foreign> flowers,* prepared as ornaments for the bower.</l>
<l n="d">The fragrance of burning incense inspired pangs of love as it diffused its delightful fragrance without cease.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">Inside the princess was being attended*..............</l></p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">.......The religious rites had been performed and all was set ready</l>
<l n="b">For the reverential salutations, auspicious ceremonies and acts of worship in the presence of the kings.</l></p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12"><l n="a">Many glorious prayers of offering were recited there.</l>
<l n="b">The music of the <foreign>paḍahi</foreign> drums for their entertainment and the singing too, were delightful.</l>
<l n="c">As night fell, this most excellent scene was suddenly bedecked in new raiment,</l>
<l n="d">From the bright glow of lighted lamps, like an assembly of suns.</l></p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13"><l n="a">We will not tell of this. After the completion of the wedding* ceremony, the bridal couple</l>
<l n="b">Came back and moved to their palanquin, like flower buds inundated by rain.</l>
<l n="c">To the accompaniment of the lovely <foreign>gamĕlan</foreign>, sweet and soft, they set off.</l>
<l n="d">The tramp of the people escorting them sounding like the rumbling thunder that always accompanies the month of spring.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="48">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">They went up into the sapphire bower where they were to join* in sexual union.</l>
<l n="b">How enchanting was its beauty, its covers perfumed with the seven fragrances* and scented with fragrant saffron.</l>
<l n="c">The aroma of camphor and the perfume of the <foreign>jĕnu</foreign> were a call to love-making</l>
<l n="d">Clearly awakening longing in the hearts of questing* lovers and bringing them pangs of love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Within there, Pārtha, enraptured, held the princess on his lap.</l>
<l n="b">Moreover, the whispered urgings of the God of Love aroused him and filled his being with desire.</l>
<l n="c">He was overcome with the confusion of unrequited love and was forced to hide his feelings, as the wedding attendants* returned to the bed-chamber,</l>
<l n="d">While his desire unfurled little by little, like the shoots of the <foreign>gaḍung</foreign> vine reaching towards the light of the moon.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The princess, goddess of love, in her confusion and distress, turned away, uneasily sighing as he tried to woo* her.</l>
<l n="b">Sudden tears filled her eyes and, as they fell, seemed to turn to liquid honey.</l>
<l n="c">Her arching brows drew together in a frown as the prince embraced her,</l>
<l n="d">Her desperate heart crushed as he held her on his lap, sad and fearful as he tried to reassure her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The prince, dejected by this, pondered deeply on how to win her affection.</l>
<l n="b">Perplexed and agitated by his love, he passionately embraced her slender waist.</l>
<l n="c">Because of his joy, he felt impelled to listen* only to his heart, the seat of his strong desire,</l>
<l n="d">With a constant flood of sweet endearments and caresses which might woo her to the delights of love:</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">‘My darling, you have ever been the deity of my meditation [enthroned] in my love-sick heart. You are the Goddess of Love, Ratih, in human form.</l>
<l n="b">You are the invisible essence which arises from the immaterial state of the depths of feeling of one who longs to know the secrets of the raptures of love.*</l>
<l n="c">You are the embodiment of honey, the goddess of flowers, the splendour of <foreign>asana </foreign>blossoms, the jewel of maidenhood,</l>
<l n="d">The beauty of the fourth month, a bejewelled statue transformed into a girl.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">‘So little sister, it seems that I have reached my goal now that I hold you on my lap and draw near to you.</l>
<l n="b">You are the one I have longed for constantly and the reason I have sought to come to you now, to take you upon my knee.</l>
<l n="c">You are the very jewel of my heart, wherein is set the innermost kernel of my devotion to love.</l>
<l n="d">To achieve my purpose, I have risked all, that I might be one with you and succeed in enjoying your favour.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">‘But now I* am in despair, how can you repay me with but a glance, while I suffer under my unyielding desire?</l>
<l n="b">See how my heart breaks as I hold back my love, though you could set me free with words of love.</l>
<l n="c">Clearly, my life must cease, for you have mortally wounded me, O jewel of the palace.</l>
<l n="d">Indeed, I have treasured the praise* of your charms in my dreams, but I grow weary at encountering only sullenness.’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Thus, the prince cajoled her with words sweet enough to drive away the princess’s reluctance,</l>
<l n="b">Like a frenzied bee whispering softly to a profusion of fragrant <foreign>asana</foreign> flowers that have not yet opened.</l>
<l n="c">Seeking to obtain happiness with soft words while inhaling her perfume, embracing her tightly,</l>
<l n="d">Full of passion but gentle, he bent his intent gaze on her, determined to seize her waist.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="49">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">But the princess turned away from the prince’s sweet words of comfort,</l>
<l n="b">Taking no pleasure in the charm of his words as he caressed her.</l>
<l n="c">Full of doubt, she moved away as he whispered to her, and wept as he kissed her,</l>
<l n="d">Drawing her <foreign>tapih</foreign> tightly around her huddled body, afraid that he would suddenly seize upon the opening of her <foreign>kain</foreign>, that he eyed so intently.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Her angry glance, so beautiful it melted his heart, devastated her lover.</l>
<l n="b">The frowning arch of her eyebrows wounded him and the prince, wanting only to caress her, was saddened.</l>
<l n="c">Her efforts to resist him were like those of the shoots of the <foreign>aśoka</foreign> battling against the wind.</l>
<l n="d">Her movements were those of a lotus addressed with endearing names by a frenzied bee.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The prince’s heart was intoxicated, flooded with sweet delight at the princess’s beauty.</l>
<l n="b">Ever more passionately he caressed her, softly stroking her, though she remained indifferent.</l>
<l n="c">His hands crept towards her waist, aiming for her waist band,</l>
<l n="d">And he began, once again, to assail her with sweet sound, a deluge of loving words:</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">‘My darling, you are the jewel of beauty who confuses my love-lorn heart.</l>
<l n="b">By your actions, you only enhance your sweetness and pierce me to the core.</l>
<l n="c">You constantly wound my loving heart which is ever ready to welcome your words of endearment,</l>
<l n="d">But, just like the moon, I cannot bring relief to an unopened flower bud, feverish with heat.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">‘You are as beautiful as the <foreign>asana</foreign> flowers found in the floral hair band of a hair-knot, so sweet and fragrant.</l>
<l n="b">Joyfully, I long to awaken your love, but you want to hide your charming perfection.</l>
<l n="c">I am a bee, full of love, but weary of fighting off my passion and desire for so long,</l>
<l n="d">Fearlessly inhaling your scent, happy to die if I already wore the marks of being the first one to taste of [the flowers in] your hair-knot.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="50">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">‘Oh how disappointed am I in love and so I will tell of the nature of my wistful longing.</l>
<l n="b">It is unbearable, though my heart would beat a little faster if addressed with words of love.</l>
<l n="c">Instead, I am full of ardent longing, because I embrace your waist and restlessly seek your approval,</l>
<l n="d">In the mistaken belief that you might be touched by passion, when you see the suffering of one who is so filled with desire.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">‘Oh I am overpowered with longing and have lost patience because of the urgings of the God of Love.*</l>
<l n="b">Thrown into confusion at the slightest touch of your finger tips or shapely calves, bewildered with desire,</l>
<l n="c">My heart is flooded with desperation, I am rendered powerless by your hair-knot, I ache when your sweet eyes fall on me.</l>
<l n="d">I know not what to do. What can I say to persuade you to accept my words?’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">But the princess’s thoughts were sad,* as the prince continually honoured her again with words.</l>
<l n="b">‘My darling wife, accept my care as I cradle you on my lap and hope to make love to you.</l>
<l n="c">If you must deny me access to your smile, then scratch me instead with your sharp nails.</l>
<l n="d">I would rather die. What is death by comparison to the dangers faced in seeking refuge in the realm of love?</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">‘In short, behold the state of this lover who presents to you his words of love,</l>
<l n="b">Hoping always that in your love I might find the place I so tirelessly seek, where I can lay down my sorrow and passion.</l>
<l n="c">I will stop without ever reaching my goal of having you as my support, O jewel amongst maidens,</l>
<l n="d">And it would be preferable for me to slink away in shame if you will not receive me kindly.’</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="51">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">Thus said the prince. The princess moaned dejectedly,</l>
<l n="b">Powerless to resist the prince any longer, unable to ward off his persuasive words.</l>
<l n="c">The broken points of her nails were of no use and so, her efforts to resist him were easily defeated and brushed aside,</l>
<l n="d">And the prince persisted in his efforts to kiss her more and more passionately.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The princess was so confused, her resistance so ineffectual, her heart so anxious as she sighed,</l>
<l n="b">That it truly seemed her tears should have deterred the prince.</l>
<l n="c">But it was too much, she could no longer think of striking him, defeated, tired beyond measure,</l>
<l n="d">As the prince continued to shower her with words as sweet as the ocean of honey:</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="52">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">‘Dear maiden, heart’s desire, give me the gift of your glance. Do not be cross or avert your gaze. Look at me!</l>
<l n="b">What a pity it is, my beloved, that in your anger, you do not care if I am suffering with desire or beset by pangs of love.</l>
<l n="c">Oh, do not weep, do not moan or be dejected, how can I continue to serve you, if you will not speak? </l>
<l n="d">In short, how can you disappoint me so in my quest to obtain your support* to help me draw near to you?</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">‘It would be better if you would but bestow your sweetness on me, so that I might match it with my steadfast* love.</l>
<l n="b">For your whimpering is in vain and only makes you weary and distresses you. How can it possibly be right?</l>
<l n="c">Indeed, you only strike my breast and threaten me with your terrible nails and conceal the redness of your teeth.</l>
<l n="d">Certainly, my dear, if you would but accept my approaches, I would find the proper way* to worship you.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Thus, Arjuna’s love became words of such sweetness that they would vanquish liquid sugar,</l>
<l n="b">His heart compelled him to restrain his longing no more, though she cried out, continually pushing him away.</l>
<l n="c">But the princess was too exhausted, deprived of all strength and her tears were to no avail as she fought him off.</l>
<l n="d">She did not know what to do as the prince, approaching her from the side,* took her forcibly.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">In short, though the princess resisted him, she was powerless, distraught, as he took her by surprise,</l>
<l n="b">Undoing her clothing, releasing her fragrance as her beautiful <foreign>kris</foreign>-shaped waist was laid bare,</l>
<l n="c">So that Dhanañjaya became even more exhilarated at this foretaste of the love-making to come,</l>
<l n="d">Just as the bee, catching the first glimpse of the beauty of an <foreign>asana</foreign>, is suddenly driven to sip its honey.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="53">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">After he had deflowered her, that most excellent of maidens was exhausted and weak.</l>
<l n="b">The prince, desire unabated, cradled her, his heart full* of deep yearning.</l>
<l n="c">The beautiful girl was the embodiment of the splendour of a wilted lotus,</l>
<l n="d">But because she was so painfully affected as she sank down, he whispered sweet words to her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The prince was even more disturbed by the princess,</l>
<l n="b">As in the light of the lamps,* she seemed even more wan and pale.</l>
<l n="c">Now, so exhausted was she that she lay there as still as a statue of gold,</l>
<l n="d">As the prince gently embraced her, cradling her on his lap and rearranging her robe.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">But the woebegone princess dejectedly slipped away from him.</l>
<l n="b">She was aghast at the blood glistening on her dress.</l>
<l n="c">So her adoring lover, not wanting to leave her side, carried her out</l>
<l n="d">To the outer verandah, going to find attendants to bathe her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">Her maids were waiting, close at hand, with everything all prepared</l>
<l n="b">And laid out in position for bathing her. All were skilled in understanding subtleties and giving guidance,</l>
<l n="c">All versed in soothing and bestowing great care on her.</l>
<l n="d">We will not tell of the goddess as she was bathed there beside her lover.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">After they had both been bathed, the girl who had now just experienced the intimacy of marriage,</l>
<l n="b">Was petted and watched over* by her loving maid:</l>
<l n="c">‘Dear lady, resign yourself to bear a little pain,</l>
<l n="d">For your sorrow will soon turn to desire, my dear.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">‘The flowers of the fragrant lotus, jasmine and <foreign>nāgapuṣpa</foreign></l>
<l n="b">Are nothing less than a sign* that it is appropriate</l>
<l n="c">For passionate bees to buzz around* them and ravish them.</l>
<l n="d">No mistress, I believe that being married is similar.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">‘Little one, you should return quickly to the pavilion. Oh, do go back my dear.</l>
<l n="b">The one who yearns for you is held in thrall, and eagerly awaits you.’</l>
<l n="c">And she urged her so insistently that the princess was ashamed</l>
<l n="d">And mounted slowly back into the fragrant bridal chamber.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">On her return, the princess huddled in the farthest corner of the beautiful chamber.</l>
<l n="b">The prince, with mounting joy, took her onto his lap,</l>
<l n="c">Caressing her and looking closely at her pale, drawn face,</l>
<l n="d">Then kissed her passionately, his sweet words falling like rain drops:</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="54">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">‘You are the very relative of the moon, you are the rumbling of the thunder of desire, the gentle rain of the raptures of love.</l>
<l n="b">You bring me constant heartache, so that I burgeon with passion, and my love puts forth new shoots.</l>
<l n="c">Moreover,* as I embrace your charms, suddenly offering me flowers of desire,*</l>
<l n="d">My joy knows no limit in being intertwined with you in the reality of sexual union.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">‘Now see, beloved, how fortunate I am to be your partner and share love with you.</l>
<l n="b">You, my lady, signify the end of my earthly existence. You are the provisions I will carry to the next world as I lie next to you in repose.</l>
<l n="c">Indeed, in the hidden depths of your eyes, transfixed, I let myself be carried away on the tide of my yearning,</l>
<l n="d">And I, your humble slave, will die willing, by casting myself* into the sea of honey to be as one with your sweetness.’</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="55">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">In this way, he calmed the princess as he sought to comfort her.</l>
<l n="b">Enchantingly, he cradled her head in his lap, giving her delicious betel-leaf, eagerly kissing her lips,</l>
<l n="c">Brushing back her hair, skillfully bestowing great care on her,</l>
<l n="d">Holding her hand, never wearying of resting his eyes on the fullness of her breasts.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">All the while, softly, tremulously, he murmured love poems, wave upon wave of sweet sentiments,</l>
<l n="b">Alternating with the pleasure of passionately kissing her beautiful cheek. </l>
<l n="c">With the sweetest expressions of love, he began all over again* to address her fondly,</l>
<l n="d">Disturbing the newly blossoming areca flower, filling her with the constant sound.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The union of the prince and most excellent princess, there on the bridal couch,</l>
<l n="b">Could be likened to that of the <foreign>mangunĕng</foreign> and jasmine or the <foreign>katirah</foreign> touching the <foreign>wĕlas-harĕp</foreign> creeper,</l>
<l n="c">As beautiful as the charming <foreign>gaḍung</foreign> entwining and merging with the <foreign>wanañjari.</foreign>*</l>
<l n="d">Such was their union, as they shared together in the raptures of love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">The delighted prince abandoned himself to the pursuit of erotic pleasure, there on the couch,</l>
<l n="b">All night long, unable to sleep, so often did he caress the princess.</l>
<l n="c">His words of love could be heard by the women hidden behind the curtains spying on them, and their sighs,</l>
<l n="d">And the constant tinkling of their anklets, told of their penetration into the secrets of sexual intercourse.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="56">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The night passed and as day came, the bright light of the sun shone down.</l>
<l n="b">When it was time for the <foreign>kraban</foreign> ceremonies and everything was ready,</l>
<l n="c">Everything was so wondrous and incomparable that it seemed to have come from Indra’s heaven,</l>
<l n="d">For it was King Harimūrti who had ordered them to be prepared and had seen to their arrangement.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The exquisite seven fragrances,* deer-navel musk and sandalwood spread over all,</l>
<l n="b">Bringing enchantment to the girl who had for the first time known a man there on the couch.</l>
<l n="c">Incense glowed, its vapour seemed to waft* there to enhance the delight,</l>
<l n="d">Seeking out the radiance of the <foreign>cawĕli</foreign> silk of the curtains, always so fragrant.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">The delightful melodies of <foreign>kidung,</foreign> accompanied on the lute, began to play,</l>
<l n="b">Sounding so much like bees that everyone thought it was spring.</l>
<l n="c">Then as these constant offerings seemed to increase in splendour, their thoughts turned again to love,</l>
<l n="d">An experience so wondrous that it laid to rest her fear of love-making.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">In full view, the two went out and sat side-by-side on the verandah.</l>
<l n="b">After they had bathed and put on their jewels and ornaments,</l>
<l n="c">They looked as sweet as the conjoined beauty of the lotus and honey,</l>
<l n="d">Bearing with fortitude* the presence of the maids, all of whom were beautiful and were wearing many <foreign>maṇḍaga</foreign>* ornaments.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">Finally a gentle elderly lady* from the palace charged with* their care,</l>
<l n="b">Who was learned* in interpreting auspicious signs, summoned them to come forth.</l>
<l n="c">And so the two then stood up and came out to the audience hall,</l>
<l n="d">Where the Yadu tribe was being sumptuously entertained as they feasted outside.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">To tell of all that took place would take too long. As day departed,</l>
<l n="b">The bridal pair moved away together to the beautiful pavilion where they would spend the night.</l>
<l n="c">People thought of them as the beautiful <foreign>asana</foreign> flower and the bee,</l>
<l n="d">As the two lovers devoted themselves to each other with caresses, shared comforts and sweet whisperings.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">The princess’s apprehension then ceased as her love unfolded</l>
<l n="b">Because the sweet prince completely won over her downcast heart.</l>
<l n="c">Like the deep joy of ivory bamboo when it comes into contact with the rain from the clouds,</l>
<l n="d">Desire pierced her, filling her to the core, as she became one with the prince.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">It was the same for the prince, as he sought release from passion in their sexual union,</l>
<l n="b">A devotee of loving, that reached perfection there on the couch.</l>
<l n="c">His languid sidelong glance was the box of sacrifical unguent he placed on her firm breasts*</l>
<l n="d">And his caresses were the acts of worship arising from his invocation of the presence of the god in their sexual union.*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Later, they ate the delicious food that lay ready.</l>
<l n="b">The food, drink and delicacies were quite perfect.</l>
<l n="c">Any wonderful gift, anything at all that they desired, was there</l>
<l n="d">Because of Kṛṣṇa, the paramount, heroic king, who was the embodiment on earth of the incarnation of the eight kingly virtues.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="57">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">And so it was that their union was a thing of joy.</l>
<l n="b">Never wearying of each other, one in spirit were they in the interchange of love and passion.</l>
<l n="c">Many months went by. Their every action was in harmony,</l>
<l n="d">Their happiness grew with the burgeoning of their great love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">We will pass over the description of their marriage.</l>
<l n="b">The twelfth year of exile came and went.</l>
<l n="c">Phalguṇa’s mind then turned to thoughts</l>
<l n="d">Of those he had left behind.* How could he now abandon them?</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">It is in the nature of existence that the pain of separation cannot prevail.*</l>
<l n="b">Great longing then subtly takes up residence in the heart</l>
<l n="c">So that sorrow and loss of peace of mind take possession of it,</l>
<l n="d">And it may happen that one forgets the gifts of the wheel of existence.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">And so Pārtha’s mind was troubled</l>
<l n="b">And he said to his bride:</l>
<l n="c">‘My darling wife, my little sister, you are indeed my very being.</l>
<l n="d">O my lady, you purge my longing and put an end to my sorrow.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">‘But now increasingly my own desires defer to</l>
<l n="b">My great devotion to my beloved mother* and brothers.</l>
<l n="c">Because for so long now I have left them abandoned,</l>
<l n="d">I think only of what has become of them in the palace there.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">‘But my devotion to you, my dear is ever constant.</l>
<l n="b">I wish to share your love. Come with me to my own home,</l>
<l n="c">And stay with me there in Indraprastha. My dear, have no fear.</l>
<l n="d">Our hearts will find perfect peace in living in accordance with what is right, my darling.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">‘So here is the course we must take, my beloved.</l>
<l n="b">It is my duty to pay homage in the dust at the feet of the King </l>
<l n="c">And your place is to be beside me as my faithful and beloved wife.</l>
<l n="d">And thus you too may properly carry out the wishes of Yudhisthira, the son of Dharma.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">Thus said the prince, lovingly addressing her with kind and gentle words.</l>
<l n="b">So the princess gave him answer, her voice faltering:</l>
<l n="c">‘O my Lord, I know what you say is virtuous and right.</l>
<l n="d">How could I not follow the proper duty of a wife?</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">‘It is only that I am bewildered, torn in two by how I will suffer and yearn</l>
<l n="b">Greatly for my own mother and my lord the king, </l>
<l n="c">Not forgetting my brothers, who call to me with longing, holding me back.</l>
<l n="d">I cannot repay their love by bringing them grief.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">‘My devotion to my parents is beyond words</l>
<l n="b">Truly it as great as both the mountains, Hima and Sumeru.</l>
<l n="c">But if I told of my love for you,</l>
<l n="d">It would truly be wider than the widest ocean.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11"><l n="a">We will say no more of their conversation</l>
<l n="b">After they had agreed to the prince’s resolution.</l>
<l n="c">That night they slept in mutual delight in the fragrant bed,</l>
<l n="d">Their hearts absorbed in joining together in desire, swept away by passion.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="58">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The next morning, the prince and his beloved awoke and came out from the bower.</l>
<l n="b">They went to the water-spouts where they bathed joyfully together.</l>
<l n="c">When they left the water, they gently stroked each other’s faces, blowing into each other’s eyes,*</l>
<l n="d">Arranging flowers here and there,* he decorated the princess’s fragrant hair-knot.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">After adorning themselves fittingly, they came forth hand-in-hand, strolling away together.</l>
<l n="b">It seemed that Manmatha, the god of the love-couch, was present in his eyes and in his sweet teeth.</l>
<l n="c">There, on the tiled verandah, they sat together with thighs touching,</l>
<l n="d">And any who saw the princess sitting on his lap, exchanging chewed betel, thought they were the God and Goddess of Love.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">‘If I were to die, how delightful it would be if I could return as a bee.</l>
<l n="b">I could passionately enjoy your charms for ever, if they were in the fragrant <foreign>asana</foreign> flowers in the garden.</l>
<l n="c">I would know ecstasy even if the <foreign>gaḍing</foreign> repulsed and wounded me or I were struck down by a rain of honey.</l>
<l n="d">If I died, but bore the signs of my joy at making love to you, I would have reached heaven.’*</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">This was the way Pārtha spoke, his words as sweet as the incarnation of syrup.</l>
<l n="b">Delighted and full of ardent longing, he entwined the fingers of her hand, then reached out* to encircle her waist.</l>
<l n="c">Like the <foreign>jangga</foreign> embracing the slender young shoots of the ivory coconut, he softly directed himself to her ear,</l>
<l n="d">But the goddess turned away sighing again, languishing as the prince caressed her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">We will not tell of their love. Finally they came forth, making their way to the inner court.</l>
<l n="b">There the prince and the most excellent princess entered the presence of king Basudewa who was there with Halāyudha</l>
<l n="c">And Lord Kṛṣṇa. The lovers both came there,</l>
<l n="d">And bowed reverently at the king’s feet. He at once received Dhanañjaya benevolently.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">The prince paid obeisance: ‘I beg you, O King, to hear my request.</l>
<l n="b">I seek leave to return to my home and therefore, I, your humble servant,* kiss your feet.</l>
<l n="c">Please do not think that I am ungrateful or indifferent, or that I wish to cast aside your favour</l>
<l n="d">Or seem to neglect my duty, for indeed, those who would be freed from their bonds face great difficulties.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">After Dhanañjaya had begged leave, the king embraced him:</l>
<l n="b">‘Oh my son, I understand, my boy, that your heart is firm in our cause.</l>
<l n="c">But if you must go, then I shall divide my kingdom, lands and possessions,</l>
<l n="d">And all the most excellent things that befit a king throughout our kingdom you will enjoy, now you are close-bound* to us.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">‘Indeed always be generous, my son, when you see the worthlessness of those who have no protection, show them compassion.</l>
<l n="b">May you never encounter difficulty, or be neglectful of the teachings, cruel in your affections, or harsh.</l>
<l n="c">My daughter, apply yourself well, for clearly it is your duty to serve your lord and show him every care,</l>
<l n="d">And thus you will come to know the love of Kuntī, your Lady Aunt* and elder brothers if you always bear in mind the duties of a younger person.’</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">Thus was his advice, and the prince, who thought it was like the water of life, then bowed* in reverent acknowledgement.</l>
<l n="b">Lord Kṛṣṇa declared that he would accompany them home, because he loved them so.</l>
<l n="c">Nor did Baladewa wish to be left behind, he too wanted to go with the prince</l>
<l n="d">But resolutely the prince denied them, saying that in the future they would certainly visit.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="59">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">We will not tell of their deliberation.</l>
<l n="b">Away sped a messenger carrying the king’s words</l>
<l n="c">To Yudhiṣṭhira and his consort,</l>
<l n="d">Making his way to the kingdom of Indraprastha.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">We will not tell of the departure of the royal messenger</l>
<l n="b">But again tell of Pārtha.</l>
<l n="c">From the court he returned to his quarters,</l>
<l n="d">Where many members of the Wṛṣṇi family visited him with offers of assistance.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Their offerings as they came to pay homage were delightful.</l>
<l n="b">All were weeping, so filled were they with love,</l>
<l n="c">Their affectionate natures dominating them and overwhelming them</l>
<l n="d">With constant thoughts of love for the princess.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">And as for the princess, she too was moved to tears</l>
<l n="b">And wept bitterly, her heart moved by compassion,</l>
<l n="c">Disheartened and saddened now that separation was imminent,</l>
<l n="d">Not knowing what to think, suddenly beginning to lament.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="60">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">The ladies of the court who together were charged with the regulation of affairs* in the inner chamber,</l>
<l n="b">Were frantically busy, for suddenly, not only did they have to make preparations but also apply themselves to embroidery.*</l>
<l n="c">But we will not describe those who were to accompany them to Indraprastha, all were impatient to go.</l>
<l n="d">All through the night came a quiet hum as they threaded strings of ornaments very carefully.*</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="61">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">We will not tell of this. The next morning, at the appointed time, when the countryside was fresh,</l>
<l n="b">Pārtha bid farewell and set off with his beloved.</l>
<l n="c">Together, all watched them climb into their seats in their chariot,</l>
<l n="d">As with Dāruki, their charioteer, at the ready, they left in magnificent and splendid style.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">The Wṛṣṇi troops, who would be the guard on their journey, were prepared and at the ready.</l>
<l n="b">Immediately they too set off from the palace, in a procession of chariots,</l>
<l n="c">Leaving those left behind so despondent that they could only stare anxiously after them,</l>
<l n="d">Lost in thought and grieving, as if they longed to set off after them and go too.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">Great indeed was their yearning. But we will tell now of the son of Pāṇḍu.</l>
<l n="b">On and on he journeyed, past settlements they took their course.</l>
<l n="c">The countryside through which they passed was beautiful, and again and again he stopped along the way so that they might disport,</l>
<l n="d">Thinking up all kinds of excuses* to comfort his beloved’s heartache.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="4"><l n="a">They came upon many different villages, and all were expecting them,</l>
<l n="b">Ready to offer tribute, for indeed the prince was truly a man of distinction endowed with every good quality.</l>
<l n="c">Thus, there was no hesitation at all because he repaid them joyfully with royal grants,</l>
<l n="d">And all surrendered their hearts in homage and respect to him.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5"><l n="a">It would take too long to tell of the time they spent on the road, stopping overnight here and there.</l>
<l n="b">They came to Indraprastha where they were welcomed by the whole court,</l>
<l n="c">Chief amongst them Kuntī and the sons of Pāṇḍu, with Yudhisthira in first place.</l>
<l n="d">‘It is like a ray of light in the darkness’, thought the people throughout the land.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6"><l n="a">Without further ado, Lady Kuntī delightedly embraced Pārtha’s bride.</l>
<l n="b">Because she had looked forward so eagerly to their arrival,</l>
<l n="c">All she could say was: ‘My dear daughter! My son!’ so moved that her tears began to flow</l>
<l n="d">And deluged the hair-knots of the two who paid her homage there before her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="7"><l n="a">As for Dharmatanaya, he too was full of joy,</l>
<l n="b">As were Bhīma, the heroic Nakula and his brother, all were also overjoyed</l>
<l n="c">To see Pārtha, returning as a world conqueror to his family, </l>
<l n="d">Moreover, he had won the world-renowned goddess of the Yadu tribe.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8"><l n="a">It would take so long to describe the happiness of the king and all the court.</l>
<l n="b">The five sons of Pāṇḍu returned together to the palace,</l>
<l n="c">Accompanied by Kuntī. Ever at the side of Subhadrā, Pārtha’s wife,</l>
<l n="d">Was the Lady Dropadī, who looked to her needs and was full of affection for her.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9"><l n="a">The homage that had been prepared for them was extraordinary.</l>
<l n="b">They were received with prayers of good fortune by the court priests and the foremost among learned religious leaders.</l>
<l n="c">The feasting and ceremonies were perfect,</l>
<l n="d">And all the ladies of noble birth, overcome with love, were happy to serve them.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10"><l n="a">And thus Phalguṇa returned, his fame yet more renowned.</l>
<l n="b">Ever more safe and sound was that most excellent kingdom, now restored to prosperity, knowing no impediment.</l>
<l n="c">The members of each caste and stage of life,* as well as all the common people knew good fortune once again, as they had before.</l>
<l n="d">Yudhistira, son of Dharma, in his most wondrous and excellent majesty, was the parasol protecting the whole world.</l>
</p>
</div>
<div type="canto" n="62">
<p rend="stanza" n="1"><l n="a">He* was as perfect as god Indra. How could his power, that so abounded in goodness, be surpassed?</l>
<l n="b">Shamed, the evil-doers stopped. They were destroyed and good men prospered.</l>
<l n="c">The admonitions of the great seer were undiminished, for he had instructed them in the proper course for those cursed to rely on the senses.*</l>
<l n="d">In short, the four brothers were the source of his strength, while the sage kept watch over the eldest among them always.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="2"><l n="a">Blameless was he, occupying himself constantly with his subjects, fostering <foreign>dharma</foreign> like a light in the darkness of the land.</l>
<l n="b">Renowned throughout the world for his great courage, his might ever the strong protection of the world.</l>
<l n="c">As long as the <foreign>kṣatriya</foreign> warriors lived in righteousness, no evil could befall those who led the hermit’s life.</l>
<l n="d">In prosperity, he was the place of refuge for the helpless, caring for them, succouring them.</l>
</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3"><l n="a">And so, now here ends the story in praise of him who is the caretaker of the world.</l>
<l n="b">It is called <foreign>The Journeying of Pārtha</foreign>, the work of one who humbly seeks help and audaciously presumes to imitate [great poets].</l>
<l n="c">Deficient though it is, may it be received by the most excellent of men, may he not take offence at it, even though it is without merit.</l>
<l n="d">May His Majesty, Surawīrya, have compassion and give his blessing to my efforts to capture beauty in verse.</l>
